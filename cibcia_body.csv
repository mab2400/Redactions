2. Unsettled conditions widespread in Asia:

 

 

 

 

-
The period from 7 to 9 March was marked ., _ e
by a series of unsettling events in Asia. T

25X1A Iranian Premier Razmara was assassinated ... ..
: on 7 March; the Turkish Cabinet resigned on wwprer=

- | 8 March, the Syrian Cabinet on 9 March; the ~+FI7*>""
Pakistan Government announced on 9 March e

- the discovery and suppression of a military

 

_ - plot to seize control; and the Thai Govern-

| ment, on the same date, was reported to be taking action against the

- v ringleaders of a coup attempt. In addition, over the weekend of 2-5
March, general Moslem criticism of recent French actions in Morocco
was voiced all the way from Africa (particularly Egypt) to Indonesia.

 

 

Comment: 25X1

 

 

 

 

. | The near-simultaneous occurrence of THESE TVENTS
| throughout a large part of Asia is suggestive of more than coincidence.
- There is, however, no evidence of Communist involvement in the in-
cidents except in Pakistan, where one of the four persons arrested

has been outspokenly pro-Communist, and possibly in Thailand. The
significance of the situation appears to rest primarily in the almost
unparalleled opportunity for Communist exploitation of such widesprcud
- simultaneous unrest. Reports from Iran indicate that such exploitation
is already in progress there.

FAR EAST

French report no Chinese Communist units in Indochina:

 

 

 

has informed 25X1
the US Military Attache in Saigon that it

has not been able to identify any Chinese
Communist units in Indochina except a motor
transport detachment operating supply trucks

 

 

 

 

 

across the border. However, the presence of Chinese military advisers
and instructors down to and including the platoon level has been confirmed.

The Attache emphasized that no evidence
of any kind available to him indicates the presence of regular or irregular
Chinese Communist combat units within Tonkin.

Comment: Reports of the entry of Chinese 25X1
military formations into Indochina are numerous and persistent. However,

the above statement] |
[would seem to refute them.

3. Britain and France request deferment of statement on German unity:

 

 

The British and French foreign offices as
well as the US High Commission in Germany
have all recommended that a proposed US
statement on German unity be deferred.
French Foreign Minister Schuman feels that
Chancellor Adenauer is handling the situation
capably, and that any three-power declaration
would be used by the West German
parliamentary opposition as well as by the
Communists as an indication of dictatorial
interference by the Western powers in German
affairs. British Foreign Secretary Morrison

 

 

asserts that the &tatement should be given further study in light of its
possible effects upon Western policy toward the East; and High Commis-
sioner McCloy believes that it must be very carefully presented in order

~ to avoid the impression that the Allies are subeordinating German unification
to the question of Germany's integration with the West. All three agree
that any statement should be coordinated with Chancellor Adenauer.

NEAR EAST

Iranian Prime Minister refuses to sign Mutual Security Act agreement:

 

 

Prime Minister Mossadeq has again refused to
consider signing the agreement required by the
Mutual Security Act which provides among other
things that the recipient country contribute to

 

 

the ""defense of the free world. "" He insisted that if formal signatures are
required, the matter must be presented to the Majlis and the Senate. He
stated that he would be neutral in presenting the matter and suggested that
Ambassador Henderson might judge for himself whether or not Parliament
would be willing to give the required assurances.

Comment: There are no indications that
Mossadeq will become more amenable to signing the agreement provided
for in the Mutual Security Act. In their present mood the two Iranian Houses
will hardly act quickly or favorably on a political matter of such an exploswe
nature.

WESTERN EUROPE

De Gaulle attacks European integration plans:

 

 

25X1A

 

A recent statement by General de Gaulle is in-
terpreted by the US Embassy as a possible fore-
runner of attacks against the US and French
Governments for having failed at European uni-

 

 

25X1A

fication by allowing Germany to become too powerful.

At a recent press conference, De Gaulle gave
the first indications that if his current bitter attacks against the European
Army should fail, he would then launch an assault on the alleged German
comeback, saying that German ""hegemony' could have been prevented had
he been granted power in time. The General predicted that the present
""weak piecemeal approach' to European integration would lead to ""disappoint-
ment and disgust"" with the European idea, and would result in the failure of
European union and in ""Atlantic disunity. ""

Comment: Both the current Géullist line and

these indications of future party tactics spell continued difficulty for the

middle-of-the-road government. De Gaulle's criticism closely parallels
Communist vituperations against the European Army and the ""American occu-
pation of France."" Such a propaganda assault is especially serious in France,
where popular sentiment is innately apprehensive both of foreign troops on
French soil and of the rebirth of a German war potential.

The Netherlands opposes other European Defense Community nations on

 

internal defense force issue:

 

 

 

The Dutch delegates to the Paris Conference on a
European Defense Community will accept the plan
favored by the French, Germans and Italians,

whereby all internal defense forces would form part of the European Defense
Force, provided that only the national governments -- and not the Defense
Community -- have the authority to commit these forces to SHAPE,

The German delegate, suspecting that the Dutch
are trying to retain the nucleus of a national army, states that if the Dutch
plan is adopted West Germany will also have to create some national forces
in order to secure Bundestag ratification.

Comment: The German delegate's remark is
prompted by hIS Parliament's insistence on equal treatment in the European
Defense Community. Since the Allies, and especially the French Government,
oppose the formation of any German national forces under a wholly German
command, the Dutch proposal would in effect discriminate against West
Germany.

The Netherlands and Belgium have intimated a
willingness to accept a common budget under international control in exchange
for a longer transition period. This may lead to conciliation on the less im-~
portant issue of internal defense forces.

Italian ratification of Schuman Plan expected:

 

 

25X1A

 

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Italian
Chamber of Deputies has already begun consider-
ation of the Schuman Plan treaty, but the US
Embassy in Rome believes ratification by both

 

 

Houses will probably not be achieved until some time in February. With
ratification in principle supported by all the democratic parties, it is
practically certain that Parliament will take favorable action after some
debate.

Comment: The majority Christian Democrats,
with the support of other moderate parties, should experience no difficulty in
securing the bill's passage, even though nationalistic right-wing elements may
join the Communist Party in opposition. Implementation of the treaty may be

WESTERN EUROPE

2. West Germans propose European scientific research body:

 

 

The West German delegation at the Paris Euro-
25X1A - pean Defense Community discussions has pro-
posed that scientific research in selected fields
be pooled by member nations. These fields
cover nuclear physics, chemical and biological warfare, telecommunications,
submarine development, guided missiles, and military aircraft. The plan
would provide a commission to regulate such research.

 

 

 

Comment: This proposal may be a German
attempt to obviate the need for a contractual convention prohibiting German
research in these fields. It is probably intended to permit German scientists
to undertake such research in Germany without incurring Allied objections.

Reduced French military program envisaged:

 

 

France will soon have to announce large re-

ductions in its military commitments and may
even have to reduce forces already mobilized,
according to an analysis by the US Embassy in

 

 

Paris. Responsible French officials realize that American assistance
cannot provide the solution to their budgetary problems, and French military
authorities are now attempting to curtail their program to fit actual financial
limitations.

Comment: The French Finance and Defense
Ministries have been at odds recently on the scope of military expenditures
for 1952, Premier Pleven has just imposed a makeshift compromise for
January and February, but a realistic appraisal of the situation may force a
reduction in the over-all military program with serious implications for NATO.

Crisis approaching in French policy on Indochinas

 

 

25X1A

 

French policy in regard to the war in Indochina
is rapidly moving toward a crisis, in the opinion
of the US Embassy in Paris. While the Embassy
does not envisage immediate French abandonment

 

 

of Indochina, it thinks that public sentiment for withdrawal is strong and will

-gain steadily, and that developments in Europe and Vietnam are forcing the

government to consider curtailing French efforts in Southeast Asia.

Comment: The French have become increasingly
insistent in recent months on the need for more help in Indochina. The
growing financial difficulties in France will probably force the government to
reduce some of its commitments. Furthermore, the US and Britain may soon
be faced with French inability to commit sufficient manpower to maintain '
their present position in Indochina.

GENERAL

Italy maneuvers for admission to United Nations:

 

25X1A

 

Italy says it has lined up seven Security
Council votes, including France's,for the
Soviet omnibus resolution on UN member-
ship. In addition, it will try to persuade

 

 

Britain to support the resolution, or at least to abstain from voting. It
hopes that the United States will abstain.

The American Embassy in Rome expresses

the hope that the United States will be able to abstain, and thus avoid

being placed in the position of having blocked Italy's membershlp in the
United Nations Organization.

Comment: Either a US abstention or a

~ vote against the resolution would provoke an unfavorable public reactlon

25X1A

in Italy.

FAR EAST

Reports of political unrest in Thailand continue:

 

 

A number of independent sources have recently

 

 

 

predicted a new outbreak of violence in Thai-
land in the near future. | | 25X1
[ ]such violence might erupt on 25 25X1

 

January, whlch is Thai Army Day. The primary cause of the tense situ-
ation is the continued friction between the supporters of General Sarit,
the Bangkok garrison commander who has been seeking the support of the
King, and those of Army Commander Phin and Police General Phao.

2R¥kBved|For Release 2003/09/02 : CIA-RDP79T00975A000500340001-8

 

 

 

Comment: Maneuvering for power within
the present ruling military clique has been continuing without cessation
since the 29 November coup d'etat, and an open clash could occur at any
time. There is, however, no firm evidence that Sarit considers him-
self strong enough to challenge the Phin-Phao faction, or that the latter
group considers itself in such jeopardy as to warrant an attempt to
eliminate Sarit.

Malayan Police rivalries hamper security operation;

 

 

 

. The abrupt resignation and departure from
Malaya of the Commissioner of Police and
his Director of Intelligence have left the
Malayan Police without effective leadership

 

 

at a critical time. The lack of a positive police program, a condition
which will continue until the staff of the newly-appointed High Commission-
er is selected.and organized, increases the opportunity for internal Commu-
nist aggression in Malaya during the next few months.

_ Comment: Inability of the British author-
ities in Malaya to eliminate top-echelon rivalries within the police

organization and between the police and the army has hampered oper-
ations against the Communist guerrillas.

SOUTH ASIA

Chinese Communists advocating ""liberation'"" of Kashmir provinces:

 

 

25X1A

 

 

| ]a propaganda 25X1
campaign is under way in Kashgar and other
cities of Sinkiang advocating the ""'liberation""

 

 

 

of the two Kashmir border provinces of Ladakh
and Gilgit on the ground that these areas are an ""integral part of China. ""

25X1

 

Comment: |
[ lthe Pakistani Consulate-General in Kashgar, near the Soviet
and Kashmir borders of Sinkiang, is still open; this report may there-
fore be based upon personal observation by Pakistani officials. Although
no Chinese government is known ever to have claimed authority over, or
to have had direct relations with, any of the provinces of Kashmir, Chinese

- Communist patrols have operated well within that state in the past year.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Czechs ready to buy oil from Iran:

 

 

 

| | 25X1

the Czechs are ready to buy up to 500, 000
tons of oil. They are now attempting to find
shipping space for it and have asked for Iran-

 

 

 

- , ian help in this matter. The Czechs wish to
pay for the oil by barter, in view of foreign exchange difficulties.

 

Comment: These proposals result from
talks conducted by the Iranian Legation at the behest of its Foreign Office,
Lack of transportation continues to be an obvious major obstacle to the
implementation of any Iranian oil transaction with Orbit countries, More-
over, oil is not an item of high priority on the Czech import list, and

WESTERN EUROPE
7. Comment on Belgium's intransigence on the European Defense Community:

Belgium's participation in the European
Defense Community is still uncertain, and current discussions in Paris
and Brussels will probably be decisive. Foreign Minister van Zeeland
has adopted an extremely cautious attitude and has stated that the Belgian
Parliament is merely lukewarm to the plan. He says that if Belgium had
to ""take it or leave it"" now, a decision against participation would recelve
popular and parliamentary approval

Aside from constitutional objections, Van
Zeeland is opposed to the top~heavy political structure borrowed from the
Schuman Plan. The US Ambassador in Brussels believes that he is also
concerned about the attitude of the Belgian King, who would probably ob-
ject strongly to a transfer of authority over the country's armed forces.

Except for the Foreign Minister's half-hearted
approaches to Parliament, there is no indication that the Belgian Govern-
ment has made a definite attempt to induce favorable parliamentary con-
sideration of the Defense Forces plan.

GENERAL
Comment on latest Soviet protest concerning the Middle East Command:

The Soviet Government's note of 28 January pro-
testing onceagain theformation-of the:Middte:Bast-Command pl acesunusual
émphasis on developments in the Near Eastern area which are unfavorably
affecting the Western power position there. The previous Soviet note
in November was a part of the continuing diplomatic campaign against
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the extension of the alliance
system te the Eastern Mediterranéan,

The latest note seems designed to take ad-
vantage of recent events in Egypt and Tunisia, to which the Soviet press
has devYoted fullest coverage. It alms at encouraging the opposition of
Near Eastern countries to the continued assertion, particularly by
Great Britain and France, of special interests ih the area. The note
also seeks to strengthen suspicions among those countries that United
States military bases there are intended to divert attention from the
continued presence of British and French troops, and that the Middle
East Command represents only a device for perpetuating Western
""occupation. ""

Moscow's real concern, however, is revealed

by the note's reference to the alleged encirclement of the Soviet Union

and Satellites, which it pittures in preparation in both Europe and the
Far East, with the Middle East Command completing the ring of military
bases around the periphery of the Soviet Orbit.

All these preparations, described by the note
as plans for a third world war, are held up to the Near Eastern countries
as a warning that their cooperation in Western defensive measures may
involve them in global hostilities.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Libyan unity threatened by King's attitude:

 

 

The Libyan King's preference for his
native province of Cyrenaica and his
apparent disinterest in the more important
and heavily populated Tripolitania province

 

 

endanger the prospects for a united Libya, according to the American
Charge in Tripoli. The King seems unwilling or incapable of thinking
of the country as a whole, Of the two cabinet ministers who have

a true all-Libya outlook, one is definitely slated to go, while the
other!s tenure appears temporary.

The Charge warns that American interests
in the area will be jeopardized by the King's attitude since Tripolitania
contains the important US air base, Whellus Field. He believes that
the American, British and French representatives should press the
King to accept his responsibilities toward all parts of his kingdom.

Comment: When Cyrenaica, Tripolitania
and the Fezzan were united to create Libya in mid-December,
separatist elements were considered a threat to its future. The
elections in February will be a major test for the state which,
without energetic federal leadership, faces an uncertain future,

Inspector General of Greek Army removed:

 

 

The Inspector General of the Greek Army,
General Kitrilakis, has been relieved
""temporarily, "" on orders of the Minister
of Defense.  All remaining pro-Papagos
officers reportedly are to be removed by
May.

 

Comment: The removal of Kitrilakis, a

 

firm s?pporter of opposition leader Marshal Papagos, is the result
of the struggle for control of the armed forces which has already
caused the ouster of several high-ranking pro-Papagos officers
who are also pro-American.

This action assumes serious proportions
because it directly violates an understanding between the American
army mission in Greece and Greek defense officials which provides
for consultation on major changes in assignment of Greek army
personnel. It is also indicative of increasing political manipulation
within the army.

EASTERN EUROPE

Czechoslovakia and Poland reportedly seek to establish missions
in Panama:

 

 

Poland and Czechoslovakia reportedly
desire to establish diplomatic missions
in Panama. When questioned about the
matter, the Panamanian Foreign Minister

 

 

said that Czechoslovakia had not made an official approach, but

that the Polish representative in Mexico had formally requested
an exchange of ministers, and had even submitted the name of
the proposed chief of mission.

The US Ambassador believes
that he may have persuaded the Panamanian Government to refuse
the Polish request. :

Comment: It was reported lastSeptember
that the Czechoslovak Minister in Washington had made approaches
to Panama for establishing official Czechoslovak representation

GENERAL

Growihg friction with Europeans over Battle Act expected:

 

25X1A

 

The United States delegate to the Coordinating
Committee on East-West trade believes that

American policy under the Battle Actislikely
to cause '""'considerable commotion,"" possibly

 

 

25X1

with serious effects on cooperation by other participating countries.

He was recently obliged to submit a modified statement on trade controls
after the original submission was severely criticized by all the other
delegates.

The European delegates objected to the .
""paternal tone"" of the first American statement and accused the United
States of trying to impose a unilateral interpretation of what hasbeen
agreed upon. - They also objected to the emphasis on the quid pro quo
principle and warned of the effect which the denial of American exports
to friendly countries would have on COCOM agreements.

4. Rhee scores unexpected by-election victory:
Government intervention, reports Ambassador
25X1A Muccio, may have occurred to some degree in
the recent ROK by-elections, in which sup-

 

 

 

- porters of aging autocratic President Rhee made
nearly a clean sweep. Seven pro-Rhee candidates were successful inthe
contest for eight vacant National Assembly seats, despite a hotly contested
campaign waged by the opposition Democratic Nationalist Party.

"" Comment: - While the success of the pro-Rhee
candidates may have been partly due to actions of the ROK police under
Rhee's notorious Home Minister '""Montana' Chang and to Youth Corps
""'goon squads,"" Rhee's prestige played the major part in the victory.

The National Assembly has been locked ina
power struggle with the President for a long time. Recently there has
been some speculation that Rhee's chances for reelection to the
Presidency have decreased. This manifestation of popular support,
however, should create a considerable desire to climb on Rhee's
bandwagon prior to the Assembly's election of a new presidentthis June.

SOUTH ASIA

Indian requirements for American food grains in 1952-53:

 

 

 

The Plamning Commission in New Delhi esti-
mates that for the year beginning 1 July 1952,
India will require from the United States
2,180,000 long tons of food grains inaddition

 

 

to quotas allotted to it under international agreements,

Of this total, the Indian Food Ministry has
earmarked funds to purchase 778,000 tons. In order to conserve dollar
exchange, the Planning Commission has suggested that another 675,000
tons, worth 65 million dollars, be granted to India under an aidprogram
similar to that recently advocated by US Ambassador Bowles. No sug-
gestion has yet been made about flnancing the remaining 727,000 tons,
which would cost approximately 70 million dollars.

Comment: The United States and the Commu-
nist Orbit are the two sources best able to supply India with the needed
food supplies. Indications are that the United States will receive the
first request for a grant or loan of most, if not all, of the 135 million
dollars worth of grain for which India has not already allocated funds.

In 1951, while the United States was considering
an Indian request for 190 million dollars worth of American grain, the
USSR and Communist China achieved a propaganda victory by offering
grain at reduced prices to India and by making delivery prior to the
arrival of the first American food ship.

' This year the Communist Orbit is ina position
to repeat last year's performance and has already indicated its willing-
ness to do so, Furthermore, Indian Communists have recently shown
unexpected strength in the national elections in the food-deficit states
of southern India; unlike last year they are now in a position to debate
food issues in both state assemblies and the national Parliament,

NEAR EAST- AFRICA

Iran may close foreign cultural offices in Tehran:

 

 

 

The Iranian Government is seriously considering
the closing of foreign cultural and information
offices in Tehran, as well as the provinces.
Although the government has assured the US

 

 

Embassy that the order closing provincial offices was aimed at the British
and Russians, not at the United States, the Embassy believes that ex-
tension of this policy to Tehran would indicate an anti-foreign policy
rather than one simply anti-British or anti-Soviet,

Comment: The Iranian Government's policy
of obtaining public support through the promotion of anti-British sentiment
has already led it to take increasingly severe measures against foreign
activities. The need to continue such a policy as well as the growing
xenophobia which it has helped create may well induce the government to
take further steps against foreigners.

 

- Israel expresses interest in cldser military ties with the West:

 

 

The Israeli-Foreign Minister has informed
General Eisenhower that Israel is directly
interested in the proposed Middle East Command
because Arab hostility has isolated the Jewish

The Indian Foreign Office advised Pannikar that
any international investigative body should have full freedom to undertake
independent investigation in the localities concerned, as well as to review
evidence submitted to it

Comment: Peiping has been criticized in Asia
for its failure to accept the American proposal that the International Red
Cross investigate the biological warfare charges.

Peiping is not likely to agree to an investigation
such as the Indians are suggesting. However, to regain the propaganda
initiative, the Chinese may be willing to discuss a proposal for the creation
of an investigative body.

Missionary reports on ""American germ air raids' in China:

 

 

A German missionary, newly arrived at Hong
Kong from Tsingtao, has supplied details on
the alleged American germ air raids there on
5 and 8 March. During the alerts, a single
searchlight played in one direction for two

 

 

hours, while antiaircraft batteries fired wildly in all directions.. No
planes were heard or seen on either date.

On 9 March, hundreds of children wearing face
masks and equipped with fly swatters and bottles, and thousands of soldiers
were led out to collect insects. For days afterwards, the police led people
on insect hunts, '

While the missionary himself is convinced that

there were no raids, he states that many Chinese believe the Communist
BW charges.

Letourneau considered best man available for Indochina post:

 

 

Minister Heath in Saigon believes that the French .
Government made the best possible choice in
appointing Minister for Associated States, Jean
Letourneau, High Commissioner in Indochina.

GENERAL

1. West German officials minimize importance of Soviet reply:

 

 

According to High Commissioner McCloy,
Chancellor Adenauer feels that the Soviet

note of 9 April represents no essential change
from previous Soviet proposals. An official

of the Ministry of All-German Affairs believes
that the statement will have even less impact

in the Federal Republic than the note of 10 March,

Adenauer contends that before a four-power

 

 

conference is held Moscow must make at least an ""approach to agreement""
on the full sovereign right of Germany to form alliances, on German

defense forces, and on fr

Moscow is still probing,

ontiers.

The Ministry representative believes that
not feeling pressed for time, He considers

that the Russians are undoubtedly prepared to develop their idea of four-
power inspection of electoral conditions. He argues that ultimately a
four-power conference will have to take place to convince the West
Germans of the impossibility of unification, but only after Western
""fencing"" with the Russians through a further exchange of notes. The
Ministry official believes that West German negotiations on integration
should be pressed without delay. :

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

2. Communist propaganda increasing in Iraq:

 

 

Communist propaganda appearing in books and
in the press in Iraq is showing a marked in-
crease in volume, It appears to follow the
Moscow line more closely than usual and is

 

reportedly prepared in pP.

Efforts of the Iraqi police to stop this type of
Communist activity have been unsuccessful because court conv1ct10ns
can be obtained only if the propaganda attacks the government or raises
issues which would directly contribute to the country's instability.

Most of the Communist activity in Iraq is

directed by a six-man group of the Iraqi Lawyers' Association. The
Communist Party is reportedly concentrating on students and intellectuals.

Papagos agrees to formation of interim government in Greece:

 

Greek opposition leader Papagos has agreed

to the formation of a short-term 'technical
government' to carry out urgently needed
economic reforms. He refuses to participate
in a vote of confidence in such a government,
however, apparently believing that to do so
would enable it to remain in power indefinitely.
He suggests that new elections be held on15 July.

 

 

 

 

25X1

 

 

Comment: The weak government coalition
has already lasted longer than was generally thought possible at its
inception in September 1951; the present proposal is one of several
made recently as the pressure for its dissolution has increased,

While the idea of an interim government may
appeal to Papagos asameans of extricating himself from the predicament
created by his party's boycott of parliament, he is unlikely to cooperate
with any government whose Ministers he can not approve.

GENERAL

1. Britain anticipates prolonged Soviet campaign against West German
integration: ' '

 

 

The British Foreign Office believes that the
Soviet note of 9 April may have been designed
to elicit a Western refusal to hold discussions
on a German peace treaty, and that such a

 

 

refusal would prejudice West German ratification of the European Defense
Community treaty and the contractual agreements. Britain favors Chancel-
lor Adenauer's suggestion that the Western reply point out the necessity
for advance agreement on essentials without actually rejecting the possi-
bility of four-power talks.

Foreign Secretary Eden urgés that the Western
reply be coordinated in London or Paris rather than in Washington toavoid
European criticism that the United States is dominating Western policy.

Comment: The chief of German affairs in the
British Foreign Office had stated earlier that the USSR could make trouble
in its efforts to prevent German integration with the West by offering
genuinely free election of an all-German government. Britain evidently
now believes that the USSR is preparing a prolonged diplomatic campaign
aimed at blocking the ratification, if not the signature, of the EDC treaty
and the Allied-German contract. _

West German ratification would be endangered
only if the Soviet Union offered proposals for unification whichguaranteed
Germany's independence.

GENERAL

1. Britain backs UN stand on Korean prisoner exchange issue:

 

British Foreign Secretary Eden has instructed
the Foreign Office to prepare a paper for cir-
culation to the other Commonwealth members
recommending support of the United Nations're-

fusal to repatriate prisoners of war against their will

25X1A

 

 

 

Comment: The Foreign Office had prev1ously
submitted to Eden a brief recommending compromise with the Communists
on this issue if necessary to prevent the collapse of the truce negotiations.
Prime Minister Churchill had informally expressed the view thatprisoners

"" held by the UN must not be handed over to face reprisals.

The other Commonwealth countries contributing
to UN forces in Korea have not committed themselves on the prisoner ex-
change issue.

2. French delegation to Moscow Economic Conference favorably impressed:

-

S5X1A f According to a French Foreign Ministry official,

the French delegation to the Moscow Economic
Conference appeared favorably impressed by the
sincerity of Soviet desire for trade. Representa-
tives of French firms discussed deals at the conference, but these are still
subject to negotiation and export-licensing approval by the French Govern-
ment,

 

 

 

 

A Soviet offer of wheat at the conference for
delivery before the end of May has now led the French Government to re-
open bilateral trade negotiations. No agreement was made with Poland,
since French requirements for coal have been met. The protocols of
trade concluded with East Germany, Rumania and China are merely ex-
pressions of intent to promote the sale of the broadly defined commodities,

GENERAL

French airliner possibly flying out of air corridor:

whether the French airliner fired on by Soviet
MIG's on 29 April was in the authorized air
corridor at the time of attack, it was shownby

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\ 25X1
of the corridor when first approached by Soviet aircraft. The French
pilot, however, asserts that his aircraft was in the corrldor throughout
the flight.
Friction reported in Sino-East German commercial relations:
The China Export Corporation, an East German
company engaged in selling Chinese products to
the West, reportedly lost 18 million dollars in
1951 because the merchandise received was of 25X1

 

 

inferior quality, | ' the managing director
of the corporation was dismissed by East German authorities for hisfailure
to examine the Chinese goods on arrival,

The Chinese are now refusing to supply products
to the corporatmn pending the signing of a 1952 trade agreement. The USSR

is said to be bringing pressure on the East Germans to sign such a pact, Y

FAR EAST

3. Indonesia proposes lifting embargo on rubber to China:

 

 

The Indonesian Government has prepared for
circulation at the Ottawa Rubber Conference
in May a memorandum recommending termi-
nation of the embargo on rubber to China,

 

 

The United States is criticized for not absorbing the rubber surplus re-
sulting from the embargo, and its ""price depressing policies"" areblamed
for aggravating growing economic difficulties in Indonesia. These diffi-
culties are repeatedly linked with the problem of maintaining law and
order,

In conclusion, the memorandum asks why Indo-
nesia should not be ""free to sell rubber to any country which is prepared
to buy it,""

Comment: The Rubber Study Group, which
is holding the meeting in Ottawa, is not a policy-making body and is with-
out power to act on Indonesia's recommendations, | 25X1

 

 

 

 

 

 

this memorandum is the first official admission of an intent

 

to break the embargo, and it is further evidence of the new government's
determination to return to a strictly''neutralist' foreign policy.

4, Syrian officers on observation tour of Yugoslavia:

 

 

 

Nine Syrian Army officers left Damascus by
air for Belgrade on 29 April, According to
the American Minister, the Yugoslav Govern-
ment invited the officers in order to counteract
propaganda stating that the Tito regime is
mistreating Moslems,

The American Minister believes that the chief

reason for Syrian interest in the tour is to observe ""Yugoslav military
training tactics and resourcefulness in obtaining foreign aid.""

Comment:  Although recent reports have re-
ferred to Yugoslav and Albanian inferest in Syria and Lebanon, there is
nothing to link these to this unexpected Syrian mission to Belgrade.
Yugoslavia has shown particular sensitivity to any criticism of its Moslem
minorities and it has constantly sought Arab as well as Moslem support
in the UN,

, Syria's dominant political figure, Army Chief
of Staff Shishakli, has been trying for some time to obtain extensive
foreign military assistance and is reportedly ready to accept help from
almost any source., Syria has received small amounts of arms in the
past year from France and from private companies in Italy,

The American Air Attache in Budapest observed

at Tokol airfield on 27 April. Three of the air-
craft were operational types and the remaining
two were trainers.

 

 

 

Comment: No light jet bombers have previ-
ously been identified in umfs of the 59th Air Army, based in Austria and
Hungary.

FAR EAST

Japan informally requests American ""political"" loan:

 

25X1A

 

The Japanese Government has approached
Ambassador Murphy informally to request
his support of a 100 to 200 million dollar
line of credit by the United States.

 

 

Finance Minister Ikeda, while reiterating
Japan's need for fresh capital, told the ambassador that it is poli-
tically necessary for the Yoshida government to have this support
from the United States prior to the general elections expected in
October. He stated that the amount of the loan was not as important
as the mark of confidence which it would constitute in the present
regime in Japan.

Comment: Yoshida's government expects
to be attacked vigorously during the election campaign on aspects of
its relations with the United States, particularly the Administrative
Agreement and the China trade policy. It undoubtedly believes that
a practical demonstration of US-Japanese economic cooperation is
essential to counter this criticism. Direct American aid to Japan

ceased in June 1951,

Little sentiment for Rhee in Korean provinces:

 

25X1A

 

American officials, reporting on political
developments from South Korean provincial
centers, generally confirm that Rhee has
little genuine popular support in his campaign

 

 

against the Assembly. They add that petitions and demonstrations
are attributable primarily to oppressive tactics by the official and
quasi-official organs subordinate to the President.

Comment: Rhee has publicly proclaimed
that his over-all campaign against the National Assembly reflects the
""will of the people. Only recently the ""Communist plot' theme was
introduced to justify his dictatorial actions of late May and early June.

Economic depression in China reported:

 

 

25X1A

 

Eye-witness accounts from several recent
arrivals in Hong Kong give a picture of eco-
nomic depression on mainland China which
contradicts Communist claims that the
economy has recovered from the effects of

 

 

the anti-bourgeois campaign.

A source from Tientsin reports thateco-~
nomic deterioration there is ""indescribable,",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A000700240001-7,/meta-51400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1952

Venezuelan measures against Soviet Charge may react against Western

25X1A

 

25X1

Ambassador Kennan warns that if the
Soviet representatives in Venezuelaare
not treated with full courtesy until they
leave, there may be serious repercussions
in Moscow not only against the Venezuelan
representative but possibly against other
missions. The Ambassador points out
that it is important not to set a precedent

 

 

for mistreatment of diplomats in the case of a break in relations.

- Meanwhile, Czechoslovakia has asked
Venezuela for permission to represent Soviet interests there, and
the Czech Vice Foreign Minister infor med the Venezuelan Mlmster
in Prague that unless the Soviet staff in Caracas were permitted to
leave Venezuela freely, the Soviet Union is prepared to take ""what-
ever steps the situation requires.",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A000700340001-6,/meta-51400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1952

GENERAL

Britain still opposes American position on Far East trade controls:

 

 

 

In a strong demarche to the American Em-
bassy in London, the British Foreign Office
has urged the United States to take the initi-
ative in getting a quadrilateral agreement

 

 

with France and Canada on the method for associating Japan with
Western trade control machinery in advance of the negotiations with
Japan beginning on 28 July.

The Foreign Office called attention to the
generally favorable reaction to Japan's request for full membership
in COCOM. According to the Embassy, the Foreign Office also
indicated that even if Japan were persuaded to accept the American
proposal for a separate Far Eastern organization, Britain would be
most reluctant to participate.

Comment: Britain's position on this issue
is influenced by its desire to protect the British economic position in
South and Southeast Asia by deflecting Japanese competition toward the
Chinese mainland, and also by its intention to relax restrictions on
trade with China in the event of a Korean settlement,

4, Karen and Chinese Nationalists reported cooperating in Burma:

 

"" The American Embassy in Rangoon is

25X1A disturbed by the increasing reports of

cooperation between Karen and Chinese

Nationalist forces in Burma 25X6

25X6

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to the Embassy, the Burmese
Government has thus far treated the Chinese Nationalist problem
with great restraint despite the widespread belief of US involvement.
Chinese complicity with the Karens could seriously undermine Ameri-
can relations with Burma. '

Comment: Reports of Karen-Chinese 25X1
Nationalist cooperation are supported by the appearance of newly-
acquired military equipment in the hands of Karen forces in eastern
Burma.

Comment on Iran's new Prime Minister designate:

The appointment of former Prime Minister
Ahmad Qavam as the new Prime Minister suggests that Iran may
adopt a more reasonable attitude on the oil issue. Friendly to Britain
and pro-West in attitude, octogenarian Qavam is one of the most astute
politicians in Iran.

If he is confirmed, he will be hampered by a
long-standing antipathy of the Shah, the country's near bankruptcy,
continued British intransigence on the oil issue, and strong national-
ist opposition. Even Qavam, who has indicated a willingness to com-
promise on the dispute with Britain, has insisted that no prime minister
who agreed to return the British to a controlling position in the oil
industry could remain in office. '

FAR EAST

 

 

 

 

2. Anti-Communist guerrilla warfare taking place in West China:

 

 

On 21 July a regiment of Chinese Communist
troops supported by nine airplanes attacked
and occupied a guerrilla base at Tachaitzu,
about 100 miles northwest of Chengtu, in
Szechwan, according to the guerrilla commander there. After taking
refuge in the mountains, the guermuas continued fighting the Commu-
nists the next day.

GENERAL

1. Principal anti-Communist powers at UN favor Indian resolution:

 

25X1A

 

The principal anti-Communist powers in

the UN favor the Indian resolution for
solving the Korean POW impasse, according
to the American UN delegation.

 

 

Britain, France and Canada feel that support

of the Indian proposal might gain ground for the West with India and
other Asian nations. The British delegation argues that if the Commu-
nists accept the Indian resolution "" we will have an armistice,",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A000900340001-4,/meta-51400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1952

GENERAL

Greek-Italian talks on Balkan defense inconclusive:

 

 

Greek Prime Minister Papagos told Italian
Prime Minister De Gasperi during the latter's
visit to Athens that he would be glad to help
resolve Italian-Yugoslav differences, although

 

 

Greece was too small a power to attempt to mediate. Papagos, who
informed American Ambassador Peurifoy of the statement, added that
he had told De Gasperi that military coordination with Yugoslavia was
essential to NATO defense planning. De Gasperi admitted this, but
declared that no Italian- Yugoslav agreement was possible until the
Trieste problem was solved,

. De Gasperi added that Italy had renounced all
ambitions in Albania, and Papagos reassured him that Greece would
pursue its claims to northern Epirus only through diplomatic means.

Yugoslav-Turkish defense accord awaits political agreement:

 

 

Yugoslavia and Turkey agreed during their
recent military talks in Belgrade that after
the necessary political agreements have been
made, a joint defense plan would be under-

 

 

taken, according to a Turkish Foreign Office official. These talks
also produced a plan for an immediate exchange of military students
and certain military information, and for observing each other's
maneuvers,

Comment: Yugoslavia desires a tripartite
mutual assistance agreement with Greece and Turkey. Both Turkey
and Greece have asked for guidance on what further steps can be taken
toward military collaboration with Yugoslavia, since they are un-
willing to make any military arrangements which conflict with their
NATO obligations, :

SOUTHEAST ASIA

6. French reportedly plan offensive in Vietnam:

 

25X1A The French are planning a landing operation
in the Thanh Hoa area of northern Annam
between 15 and 20 January, | | 25X1
25X1 | | The
attack will be a raid in force by at Ieast three battalions rather than
an attempt to occupy the area. Objectives are Viet Minh rice and
arms stocks in the area,

 

 

 

 

Comment: The Thanh Hoa area has been
held by the Viet Minh since 1945, A successful French raid, fol-
lowing the Viet Minh's failure to take Na San and its more recent

"" abandonment of objectives in Laos, could have a considerable psycho-
logical and military effect.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Ruling clique expected to win election in Iraq: .

 

 

Ambassador Berry in Baghdad reports
that candidates favored by the Iraqi Regent
and Nuri Said are expected to win approx-
imately 123 of the 141 parliamentary seats

 

 

in the elections on 17 January. Three of the four opposition parties,
including the important Umma Party of Saleh Jabr, have virtually
boycotted the elections in protest against the government's manip-
ulation of the electoral machinery.

Comment: A Regent-Nuri victory promises

no basic reforms, The ténsions which preceded the Baghdad riots
of 22 November may thus be expected to continue. ",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001000120001-6,/meta-51400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1953

FAR EAST

 

 

 

 

2.

25X1A

Peiping announces $10 billion budget for 1953:

 

 

Communist China's 1953 budget, announced
in a 16 February statement, totals an equiva-
lent of nearly $10 billion at the official rate of

 

 

exchange, or almost $7 billion at free market
rates. Projected revenues will equal expenses. 'National defense' ex-
penditures are to constitute 22,38 percent of the total, according to the
statement.

Comment: Although the 1953 budget calls
for two to three times the estimated annual expenditures prior to the
Korean war, it does not differ appreciably from estimated budget figures
in 1952. The expanded 1952 budget resulted in some inflationary pressures,
and Peiping was forced to devalue its currency by about 10 percent late in
the year. Despite this evidence of strain, the economy continued fairly
stable, and there was no imminent threat of runaway inflation,

This is the first time that Peiping has announced
total government revenues and expenditures in absolute figures.

Chinese Nationalist commander in Burma to be recalled for consultation:

 

 

General Li Mi, commander of Chinese National-
ist forces in Burma, is being recalled to Taipei
for consultation. Chiang Kai-shek reportedly
feels that he must reserve his decision on the

 

 

possible withdrawal of the troops until he has talked with Li.

Comment: Chiang has been informed of the
United States Government's view that the Nationalist troops should be
withdrawn from Burma, In the opinion of the American Ambassador in
Rangoon, any further delay in their withdrawal will seriously jeopardize
relations between the United States and Burma,

It is questionable how much control Li Mi still
exerts over his widely scattered 7,000 to 10,000 troops.

5. Heavy Tudeh infiltration of Iranian Air Force reported:

 

General Guilanshah, chief of staff of the
25X1A Iranian Air Force, recently advised the
American Embassy that more than 250
noncommissioned officers in the air force
technical brigade are suspected of Tudeh activity. Three were arrested
on 8 February and charged with giving the Soviet Union information on
air force plans for action in case of internal disorders.

 

 

 

Guilanshah wants to purge' all the suspected
Tudeh members, but he can get no action from the army chief of staff,
who must approve all air force orders,

 

Comment: 25X1

7 The American Consulate in Tabriz reported
in late January that there had been widespread arrests of local army
officers and enlisted men for suspected Tudeh activity.

7. Sudanese leaders enthusiastic over Anglo-Egyptian agreement:

 

The Sudanese are enthusiastic over the
recent Anglo-Egyptian agreement, and
25X1A many leaders have expressed the belief
that the United States was responsible
for the settlement, according to the
Awmerican Liaison Officer in Khartoum.

 

 

 

The officer adds that Wing Commander
Zulfikar Sabri, an Egyptian representative in Khartoum, has a fair
chance of obtaining Sudanese political support for an election plan
which would lead to a coalition government of the major parties,

Comment: This is the first clear indica-
tion that the agreement, which was well received in the Arab League
states, has gained the strong support of the Sudanese themselves.
The present atmosphere augurs well for an orderly transition to
independence, even though many complex problems still remain,

WESTERN EUROPE

East Germans reportedly preparing for mass-production of MIG-15's:

 

 

The East German Aeronautical Research

Institute at Prina has reportedly received
complete plans for the manufacture of the
MIG-15 jet fighter and is working on the

 

 

translation of the blueprints into German and the designing of factory
equipment for mass production,

Soviet General Lukin and Dr. Bruno Baade,
an East German aeronautical engineer formerly employed in a research
center in the USSR, recently selected plants appropriate for manufac-
turing aircraft and components.

Comment: Baade, a capable engineer and
administrator, is said to be under consideration for the future post of
East German Air Minister. reports of the construction of air-
craft factories and jet engine plants were received last summer. Jet
engine manufacture was to have started at Ludwigsfelde on 1 January
1953.

MIG-15's are being produced in Czecho-
slovakia, and assembly of components produced in the Soviet Union
is reportedly about to begin in Poland.

EDC delegations expect ultimate acceptance of modified French
protocols:

 

 

The consensus of the chiefs of the EDC
delegations is that their governments will
accept the French-proposed protocols to
the treaty in modified form ""after difficult

 

 

negotiations, "" and that France will probably try to prolong them. The
delegates agree that the letter of the treaty has been generally observed
in the protocols, but the ""European spirit"" of the treaty weakened,

SOVIET UNION

Moscow Embassy comments on Soviet governmental reorganization:

 

25X1A

 

The American Embassy in Moscow believes
that the centralization of the new government
in the hands of Malenkov and four other ex-
perienced leaders has created what may be

 

 

the best balance among the top Soviet leaders., This does not necessarily
mean, however, that possible differences are permanently settled, The
primary task has been one of filling the power vacuum and presenting an
immediate appearance of unity.

The organizational changes in strategic indus-
tries are viewed as an attempt to intensify control over the Soviet war
potential., No change in Soviet foreign policy is expected

The Embassy points to the possibility that
Mao Tse tung may be less amenable to direction by a group which has
yet to prove its ability to survive. Mao's importance has been clearly
recognized in the special attention accorded the Chinese over all other
Communist associates during the Stalin obsequies.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Mossa.deg _gslgs removal of Po;nt 1V personnel from Caspian area:

 

25X1A

 

Prime Minister Mossadeq has asked Ambas-
sador Henderson to withdraw American Point
IV personnel from the Caspian area within
four or five weeks, The Soviet personnel

 

 

reportedly have not yet been withdrawn from the fisheries, and Mossadeq
argued that they will refuse to leave as long as Americans are there,

| Henderson believes that under the circum-
stances, the Americans should be transferred to other parts of Iran,
possibly to return to the Caspian area later.

Comment: As recently as 4 March, Mossadeq
told Henderson that the Soviet Union had again complained about Pomt v
activities in northern Iran,

The Prime Minister has been under increas-~
ing pressure to implement his internal reform program and recently
suggested that Point IV be taken over by the Iranian Government., The
request to remove American personnel may be a step in that direction,

EASTERN EUROPE

Yugoslavia would rebuff any Soviet overtures:

 

25X1A4

 

Edvard Kardelj, second ranking Yugoslav
Communist, told Ambassador Allen on 6
March that Yugoslavia would rebuff any

overture the Soviet Union might now make. He said that the Yugoslav
quarrel was not with Stalin personally, but with the ""bureaucratic,
dictatorial system"" and as long as that system continued, there was
no possibility of a change in the Yugoslav attitude, '

- Comment: Yugoslavia's break with the
Soviet Union came about through a distinct clash in national interests.
Kardelj's statement supports previous estimates that the Yugoslav
Communists would not seek a rapprochement with the Soviet Union.

Yugoslavia to abandon collective farms:

 

25X1A

 

Milovan Djilas, a top-level Yugoslav Com-
munist, has informed Ambassador Allen

that his government is now drafting a decree,
to be effective before the spring planting,.

GENERAL

1. Soviet air safety proposals recommended as pbasis for further negotiations:

25X1A

 

 

Despite the disadvantages of the Soviet air safety
proposals, Western Allied air representatives
meeting at Bonn have recommended accepting them
as a basis for further quadripartite negotiations.
The single air corridor is considered unsatisfac-
tory because of the technical difficulties involved.
Counterproposals for a wider single corridor,
abolition of the approximately 13 ,000-foot flight
ceiling, and agreement on the rules governing
Soviet interception of planes straying from the
corridor were suggested.

 

 

The British Foreign Office feels that the Western
powers might yield on the prohibition of flights by combat aircraft if the
talks were endangered by Western insistence on this issue,

The French Foreign Office, however, believes
that giving up the right to arm planes might be rextremely unwise.",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001100130001-4,/meta-52800,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1953

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Mossadeq proposes new plan for arbitration of Anglo-Iranian dispute:

 

 

Prime Minister Mossadeq asked Ambassador
Henderson on 3 May if President Eisenhower
would be willing to arbitrate the Anglo-Iranian
oil dispute. Mossadeq said that he was prepared

 

 

to ask the Majlis for full authority for President Eisenhower to decide on
the compensation Iran owes the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, provided the
British gave him similar authority.

' Henderson told Mossadeq that it would not be
easy to induce Great Britain to try to find a solution so long as he remains
prime minister.

Comment: It is not likely that Mossadeq could
persuade the Majlis to accept a plan which denies it the right to veto any
decision which it does not like.

Iranian minister of court seeks US views on change in monarchy:

 

 

In a conversation with a US Embassy officer on

3 May, Acting Minister of Court Amini stated

that the differences between the shah and Mossadeq
should be settled as they benefit only the Tudeh.

 

 

He asked what US policy is toward Iran, particularly Mossadeq, and what
the American attitude would be toward the elimination of the monarchy or
the replacement of the shah.

Comment: Amini may have been seeking some
assurance on behalf of the shah that the United States would not support an
attempt to remove him. On the other hand, Amini is a member of the
previous Qajar dynasty, which the present shah's father overthrew, and he
may be supporting Mossadeq in the latter's desire to eliminate the shah.

Amini reportedly had been maneuvering for his
present post for some time, and he is an intimate of some of the shah's
enemies,

GENERAL

Soviet official links Korean and Austrian issues:

 

 

In an informal conversation with Western
representatives, the Soviet deputy political
adviser in Austria flatly stated that a Korean
agreement must be concluded before an Austrian

 

 

freaty could be signed. He said that the USSR would be at a great dis-
advantage if subsequent to withdrawal of its forces from Austria an
extension of the Far East conflict resulted in Soviet involvement in a
general war.

He stressed the importance of restoring mutual
confidence, adding that an Austrian peace treaty could then be settled
easily.

Comment: The USSR may well exploit a
Korean stalemate as a convenient excuse for further stalling on an

Austrian peace treaty and other major issues. 55X 1

WESTERN EUROPE

French say proposed strategy on Austrian treaty would play into Soviet
hands:

 

 

 

High French foreign ministry officials state
that Western efforts to obtain a revision of

the economic concessions granted the USSR
in Article 35 of the old Austrian treaty draft

 

 

would give the Russians a ''golden opportunity"" to blame the West if

the treaty negotiations fail, as is expected. Since the Austrian question
has been played up as a test of Soviet good faith, the entire Western
position with respect to the Soviet ""peace"" offensive could be profoundly
affected by such a development.

Comment: Both London and Vienna have
accepted a new American proposal calling for withdrawal of the short
treaty draft and for strenuous efforts to revise Article 35, and France
can be expected to agree reluctantly. Foreign Minister Gruber also
appears to be uneasy about this approach and has urged that the question
of revision be delayed until the Soviet position has been probed as far as
possible.

Bidault may suggest four-power talks on disarmament:

 

 

French Foreign Minister Bidault plans to
present to the United States and Britain a
note on the relation of disarmament to four-
power negotiations on German unification.

 

 

He will include a suggestion that the West ask the USSR promptly for

a conference on disarmament] | 25X1
Bidault does not believe the Russians will disarm, and his proposal

is meant to counter a possible Soviet request for a conference on

German unification,

 

 

Bidault reportedly feels such a Soviet move
would end all possibility of EDC ratification by the French Parliament,
but foresees no difficulty for ratification if the USSR should refuse to
participate in a disarmament conference.

Comment: At the 25 April tripartite meeting
in Paris, Bidault urged four-power talks with disarmament first on the
agenda as a means of forestalling a possible Soviet offer to discuss a
unified, neutralized Germany, The USSR would be likely to accept such
a proposal for propaganda purposes.

GENERAL

Comment on new Communist proposal in the Korean talks:

In their new proposal for settling the POW
issue, the Communists, while moving toward a cease-fire, still appear
determined not to accept any arrangement which would result in failure
to repatriate a substantial number of prisoners.

The T May proposal offers certain compromises,
but does not alter the Communist position on the critical point regarding
the disposition of prisoners unwilling to return after Communist ""explana-
tions' to them. The Communists continue to propose that the fate of these
prisoners be decided by a political conference..

Should the United Nations reject this proposal,

the Communists eventually might accept as an alternative the disposition
of the unwilling by the five-nation commission, which includes India.

British views regarding UN appeal on Laos:

 

 

The British Foreign Office believes that an
appeal to the United Nations on Laos should
be extended to embrace all Indochina and
should specify Communist China as the sup-

 

 

plier of war malerials. Otherwise, the Communists are likely to claim
that the struggle in Indochina is a civil war over which the United Nations .25x1
has no jurisdiction.

WESTERN EUROPE

De Gaulle's break with followers may delay Mayer's downfall:

 

 

As a result of the break between General de
Gaulle and his followers, a showdown in the
French Parliament over Premier Mayer's
program may be delayed while the non-

 

 

Communist parties vie for the deputies just cut adriit.

The Embassy believes that no more than one
third of the Gaullist deputies will remain in opposition. An important
number may shift toward the Independents, and others are expected to
join the Radical Socialists, the Popular Republicans, and the Socialists.

Comment: The dissolution of the Gaullist
parliamentary group removes the strongest rallying point for non-
Communist critics of close French cooperation with United States
policy. While it makes more certain the support of some Gaullist
deputies for the EDC, no great change in government policy on key
issues can be expected before the national congresses expected next
month.

25X1A

GENERAL

Britain prepared to discuss Formosa and Chinese UN representation
in Korean conference:

 

 

United Nations negotiators in any Korean
postarmistice political conference should
consider discussing Chinese Communist UN
representation and the disposition of Formosa,

 

 

according to a British Foreign Office draft paper. These issues would
be discussed, however, only after substantial progress toward a politi-
cal settlement in Korea,

The Foreign Office would be unwilling to dis-
cuss Indochina and Southeast Asia generally until the foregoing issues
had been disposed of. It expects protracted negotiations on the Korean
settlement, and believes that other problems will receive little serious
consideration for many months.

Comment: The Foreign Office apparently
now considers that the sifuation in the Far East will permit greater
latitude for negotiations. Previously it held that a general area
settlement could be achieved only through step-by-step negotiations
on individual problems,

Australian minister of external affairs Casey
has told the American ambassador in Canberra that Australia would,
at this stage, not vote for Communist China's admission to the United
Nations if the subject were to come up.

25X1A

Letourneau may recommend withdrawal of French troops from Cambodia:

 

25X1A

 

Minister for the Associated States Letourneau
told Ambassador Dillon that he would advise
his successor to withdraw all French forces
from Cambodia if it were impossible to con-

 

 

5.

tinue negotiations with any duly authorized representative of the Cam-
bodian people.

The French were taken completely by surprise
at the king's flight in view of their belief that he in general accepted the
terms of the agreement Letourneau had discussed with him on 23 May.

Comment: France will probably continue

efforts to discredit the king until a new French government permits
formulation of a more definite policy.

WESTERN EUROPE

American officials in Berlin expect no major Soviet concessions:

 

25X14

 

The tentative conclusion of American officials
in Berlin is that the present changes in Fast
Germany are not indicative of Soviet willing-
ness at this time to make serious concessions

 

 

to the West on German unity.

The new tactics emphasize Soviet realization
of the need for slowing the tempo and aggressiveness of socialization
in order to stem the exodus of refugees and to counter the popular feel-
ing of insecurity and discontent which was undermining Soviet objectives.
The officials point out that the East German government says nothing
about cutting down the armed forces and does not reverse the basic
socialization program, but only criticizes the methods and speed of
carrying it out.

The changes, it is believed, were timed for
the greatest possible external propaganda effect, particularly in influ-
encing West German elections and in appearing to meet some basic
Western conditions for four-power talks.

Comment: West German Social Democratic
leaders reportedly now believe that the Soviet Union is prepared to
sacrifice its position in East Germany and will agree to unification in
the hope of extending its influence through all of Germany. Chancellor
Adenauer, on the other hand, takes a more realistic view and has

voiced strong suspicion of Soviet intentions. '

3. Chinese Nationalist paratroopers used in Tungshan Island operation:

 

 

 

 

 

More than 600 Chinese Nationalist paratroopers
flown by 17 C-46 transport aircraft from For-
mosa were used in the large-scale hit-and-run
raid on Communist-held Tungshan Island, be-
tween Swatow and Amoy, according to reports
from American officials at Taipei. No enemy
aircraft or antiaircraft artillery opposed the
jump,, and alll of the transport aircraft in the
operation returned to Formosa.

Comment: As many as 7,000 Chinese National-

ist airborne and amphibious troops may have been used in this operation,
the most ambitious raid the Nationalists have yet undertaken.

Chinese Communists extend off-shore island campaign to north Fukien

coast:

 

 

 

25X1

 

 

About 1,000 Chinese Communist troops occu-
pied at least four islands off the coast of .
northern Fukien Province on 14 July, | 25X1

 

 

 

 

| Other reports indicate Com-

munist landings at islands in the immediate
area; details of the operations are not yet known.

Comment: Communist forces apparently

plan to extend their current campaign to all of the Nationalist-held
islands immediately off the mainland. An island invasion campaign
has been taking place near the Tachen Islands off the Chekiang coast
since late May, and Communist reconnaissance raiders landed on
Chinmen Island near southern Fukien in early July.

EASTERN EUROPE

8. Hungarian party members discouraged and disunited:

 

 

Rank and file members of the Hungarian
25X1A Workers' Party remain discouraged, dis-
united and frightened in spite of party leader
Rakosi's speech on 11 July, in the opinion of
the American legation in Budapest. Rakosi did not convince them that
he still is in control of the party or abate their misgivings about the
government's 'nmew economic policy.""

 

 

 

The legation believes that the program pro-
claimed by Premier Nagy and modified by Rakosi has failed to achieve
its psychological objective of persuading workers and peasants to co-
operate with the government. Instead, the speech convinced the already
skeptical Hungarians that the policy is a temporary expedient at best
and probably a complete deception. :

WESTERN EUROPE -
Comment on proposed East German wage increase:

The proposal by the East German trade unions
and Socialist Unity Party to increase the wages of lower-paid employees
in most industries and reinstate premiums for Sunday work is probably
intended to appease the population by bringing about real benefits for the
lower category workers. The new concession, however, can be expected
to go no further than other economic reforms in satisfying the demands
of the people, which have gone beyond the economic sphere in demanding
political change.

In granting so widespread a pay increase, the

East German government runs the danger of a resultant rise in prices,
which would be a further cause of popular discontent.

Food bazaars for East Berliners opposed by Western officials:

 

 

Both Vice Chancellor Bluecher and Allied
officials in West Germany fear that expanding
the food bazaar project begun on 14 June by a
West Berlin borough president might bring
prompt Soviet retaliation. Bluecher was re-
portedly cool to a plan of West Berlin mayor
Reuter whereby every resident in the Soviet
sector would receive a coupon entitling the

 

 

holder to purchase a small quantity of food at an even exchange of -
east and west marks, The vice chancellor was inclined to leave such
relief efforts to charitable organizations.

Both the French and British: Berlin comman-
dants fear that the bazaars might become trouble centers, thus pro-
viding a pretext for reprisals. American officials comment, Lowever,
that food distribution on a small scale would not be likely to bring
Soviet reprisals, and that the original bazaar should be maintained.

SOVIET UNION
3. Comment on announced Soviet plan fulfillment for the first half of 1953:

The official announcement of Soviet plan ful-
fillment for the first half of 1953 reveals a continuing decline in the
rate of economic growth. Industrial production reportedly increased
10 percent and labor productivity five percent in the first half of 1953
over the first half of 1952, Comparable official Soviet figures were 11
and eight percent in 1952 over 1951,

The announced results also show the present
extent of the new Soviet government's effort to increase the availability
of consumer goods. A 23 percent increase in sale of consumer goods
was reported in the second quarter of 1953 over the second quarter of
1952, Moreover, the only change revealed in the 1953 plan was the
additional allocation of 20 billion rubles for production and distribution
of consumer goods.

Production results in this first 1953 announce-
ment were reported on the basis of the new ministries as consolidated
after Stalin's death, making comparisons with previous periods even
more difficult than in the past.

Formosa-based airlines deny supplying Li Mi troops:

 

 

Both the CAT airline and Fooshing Airways
of Formosa state that none of their PBY air-
craft has been to Thailand within the last two

- months, according to the US embassy in Taipei.

 

 

Each company has two such planes, and all four are now on Formosa.

- Comment: The American embassy in Rangoon
reported on 14 July the Burmese government's suspicions that two un-
marked PBY's then in Bangkok were being used to supply Chinese National-
ists in Burma, and that they belonged either to CAT or Fooshing Airways.

SOUTH ASIA

Conditiong in Kashmir reportedly deteriorating:

 

 

Indian-held Kashmir is in political ferment and
its economy in a perilous state, according to

an American embassy official who recently
visited Kashmir, Sheikh Abdullah, the Indian-
Supported prime minister, is in a precarious position politically because
of popular dissatisfaction with his regime and dissension within his cabinet
over the future allegiance of the state. The embassy officer states that
Abdullah's personal relationship to Nehru is also unsatisfactory at present.

 

Comment: This first-hand report confirms
previous indications of unseftied conditions, which can be expected to
deteriorate unless there is a settlement of the Kashmir dispute.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Britain and L'lgya reach financial agreement:

 

 

The British Foreign Office and Libyan prime
minister Muntasser on 16 July concluded a
financial agreement, according to the British
Foreign Office. Subject to the approval of the

 

 

king, cabinet, and parliament, Muntasser accepted the 2. 5 million
pounds sterling annual financial aid offered by Britain.

Comment: Despite this forward step, the
treaty and annexes, which have been held up since last September, still
face a formidable obstacle in obtaining the approval they need in Libya.
Anti-British sentiment, particularly among government factions hostile to
the prime minister, has been reported on the increase. This feeling has
been abetted to a large extent by Egypt.

WESTERN EUROPE

. USSR increases forces in Berlin:. 25X

 

 

 

 

 

on 16-17 July
a strong Soviet armored force entered East
Berlin., Reports of troop and vehicle move-

 

 

 

ments indicate the presence in Berlin of the
entire Tth Guards Mechanized Division, and it is possible that elements

of another division are deployed to the east of the city, As many as 240
tanks are reportedly dispersed in various parts of the city. In the Pankow
district, the residential area occupied by high government officials is
being guarded by over 50 tanks.

Comment: Since the depafture of the bulk of
the Soviet troops from Berlin In late June and early July, elements of
at least one Soviet division have remained in the city, with their tanks

-and vehicles concentrated in several areas. The Tth Guards Mechanized

Division, however, was not one of those committed in Berlin after the
17 June riots,...

. It is possible that a show of strength is being
made by the USSR to frighten East Berlin workers into abandoning their
slow-down tactics. The precaution of guarding the Pankow residential
area suggests that trouble is anticipated.

De GaSperi's new cabinet may face parliamentary defeat:

 

 

Premier De Gasperi's new all-Christian
Democratic cabinet faces an uncertain
reception when it is submitted to parliament
about 21 July, according to the American

 

 

embassy In Rome. Some 35 of the 40 Monarchist deputies, annoyed
by De Gasperi's anti-Monarchist views, reportedly will vote against
him, ",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001200240001-1,/meta-51400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1953

GENERAL

USSR apparently maneuvering to participate in postarmistice

conference:

 

 

b

Soviet UN delegate Vyshinsky on 13
August suggested to the UN secretary
ceneral that a postarmistice political
conference should include all main

 

 

groups, countries and viewpoints interested in the general
issues, but stated that he had no definite instructions from his
government. He referred to the fact that in its prearmistice
proposal for the prisoner of war commission the Soviet Union
had suggested a group of 11 nations, including itself. Vyshinsky
added that the General Assembly should decide on the nations to
take part in the conference.

Comment: On 31 July Soviet UN
delegate Tsarapkin expressed a preference for a conference
limited to the ""two sides' in the dispute, presumably without

- Soviet participation, and argued that the General Assembly

had no responsibility under the armistice agreement to name
the participants.

Vyshinsky's shift in approach may be
in response to strong sentiment among UN members, including
Britain and France, in favor of inviting the USSR as well as
India to participate in a broad conference. The US favors a confer-
ence with the General Assembly designating representatives from
among the 16 UN nations which fought in Korea with the Communists
deciding on their own representation, which could include the USSR.

The Kremlin may now see an opportunity
for gaining indirect recognition of Communist China by a UN recom-
mentation for Peiping's participation in the conference. The Krem-
lin probably also wishes to avoid having a Soviet bid for participation
rejected and accordingly may be waiting for a coalescence of Western
sentiment before taking a firm position on the membership question.

FAR EAST

2. Amami Islands' return reversing anti-American trend in Japan:

 

 

 

The return of the Amami Islands to Japan
on 8 August may have reversed the tide of
anti-Americanism which had been gathering
momentum during the past six months, in

 

 

the opinion of the American embassy in Tokyo. It is also the first
American postoccupation action to have a significantly favorable
effect on the generally leftist Japanese intelligentsia and publicists.

Comment: The return of the islands
removes a major source of friction between the United States and
Japan. The Japanese press contrasted their return with the Soviet
Union's failure to recognize Japan's historic rights to the Habomai
and Shikotan islands north of Japan. The press also acknowledged
that American retention of the remaining Ryukyu and the Bonin
islands was necessary for Japanese security.

4, Pakistani army remains calm over Kashmir crisis:

 

Pakistani army headquarters near
Kashmir is maintaining an attitude
25X1A of complete calm with regard to the
recent developments in Indian-held
Kashmir, according to the American
army attache in Karachi. The Paki-
stani army is not contemplating can-
cellation of leaves and does not plan

to move additional troops into the area.

Comment: Pakistan, as in previous
crises, is apparently taking all possible precautions to avoid a 2EX1A
conflict, .

that despite conflicting rumors the resident general and the sultan
will reach a compromise, the exact nature of which may not be made
public. An acceptable compromise must enable the French to claim
that the sultan has accepted their demands and yet not alienate the
sultan's following.

The American embassy in Paris reports
that Premier Laniel, Foreign Minister Bidault, and Resident Gen-
eral Guillaume are confident they can use the current situation to
force the sultan to accept the French reform program. The French
authorities are also in a position to bring sufficient pressure on El
Glaoui, the sultan's chief opponent, to prevent him from upsetting
the status quo.

While the possibility of clashes between
rival factions exists, it is not probable that large-scale disturbances
will occur since the 56,000 French security forces are capable of
maintaining order. Basic tensions will not be alleviated, however,
and Fl Glaoui and his supporters will continue to be a source of
trouble,

GENERAL

Molotov again seeks French support on German rearmament question:

 

25X1A

 

Ambassador Bohlen has reported another
attempt by Foreign Minister Molotov, in a
2 September interview with French ambas-
sador Joxe, to win French support for the

 

 

25X1

Soviet policy of opposition to German rearmament. Molotov expressed
the fear that Germany would break out of ""the shell of EDC'"" and embark
on a militaristic course. He stated that the Soviet Union was primarily
interested in safeguarding itself from Germany and preventing German
rearmament.

Joxe reiterated the French position that the
German problem was not one to be discussed by France and the USSR
alone, and that there was no possibility of dividing the Allies on this
question.

Comment: Both Molotov and Soviet ambas-
sador Vinogradov in Paris have approached Joxe during the last two
months with similar arguments on the German problem.

6. French postpone fall offensive plans in Indochina:

 

25X1A The 1 September progress report on the

Navarre plan from the chief of the Mili-
tary Assistance Advisory Group in Saigon
states that the French are now planning to
counterattack in the event of a Viet Minh attack on the delta in late
September or early October. K the Viet Minh does not attack in
the delta, the French will undertake a diversionary action against
enemy forces north of that area.

 

 

 

Comment: This planning differs from
the original Navarre program, which called for an ""offensive to
forestall the enemy attack.""

25X1A

Burma denies Peiping pressure for settling Chinese Nationalist problem:

 

 

 

The Burmese foreign minister has informed
the American ambassador that the Chinese
Communist attitude toward the presence of
Nationalist troops in Burma is one of ""dis-

 

 

interested correctness' and that his government has not been pressed
to expedite their removal. The minister admitted, however, that he
had fully explained to Peiping his government's proposed courses of
action, including its pending appeal to the United Nations.

Comment: Such forebearance would create
confidence among the Burmese and might encourage them to approach
Peiping for aid in settling the Nationalist problem if other methods fail.
This course is known to be under consideration by some influential
Burmese leaders.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Shah and Zahedi reportedly disagree over control of Iranian army:

 

 

 

Ambassador Henderson reported on 7 Sep-
tember that the shah's insistence that he,

not the prime minister, should control the
Iranian armed forces has led to disagreement
between the two. The difference apparently
arose when Zahedi opposed the shah's plan

to appoint Deputy Minister Vosuq as minister
of national defense,

 

 

Zahedi allegedly said that as long as he is
prime minister, orders to the armed forces would come through him.

 

 

 

 

Comment: Dispute over control of the armed
forces, constitutionally vested in the crown, was a major cause of the

break between former prime minister Mossadeq and the shah.

Although an open rift is not expected at
this time, disagreements between the shah and Zahedi, whom the
monarch does not fully trust, will probably increase.

Anglo-Egyptian talks on Suez base seem headed for deadlock:

 

 

 

Egyptian vice premier Nasr has indicated to
Caffery that he would accept an agreement
with Britain which allowed one year for the
British to evacuate troops from the Suez base

 

 

n addition to a five-year agreement covering base operations. He also
agreed to modify his position on the procedure for gradually reducing
the number of technicians at the base. Nasr emphasized that these
concessions were ""his last word.""

An official of the British embassy in Cairo,
on the other hand, believes Anglo-Egyptian talks are ""still in a poker-
game stage"" and that the offer of a five-year duration will be lengthened
if Britain stands firm. The British embassy also discounts Nasr's
statement that political opposition makes it impossible for the Egyptian
military regime to accept a longer agreement.

Comment: The position as outlined by
the British official would support an intention to remain adamant
on a duration period of ten years for the agreement.

There is no indication, however, that the

Egyptian military regime is willing to go much beyond its present
position.

WESTERN EUROPE

Rome government seeks Italian de facto ""occupation' of Zone A of
Trieste:

 

 

According to a high official of the Rome
Foreign Ministry, a de facto occupation

of Zone A of the Free Territory of Trieste
by Italian forces on the same terms as

 

 

Yugoslavia's present ""occupation"" of Zone B would satisfy Italian
public opinion. Such a move, he told Ambassador Luce, would
also strengthen the Rome government, pave the way for Tito-Pella
negotiations, and enable Premier Pella to continue pro-NATO
policies when parliament reconvenes on 22 September.

The Foreign Ministry official believes
that Pella would order the withdrawal of the troops dispatchedto
the vicinity of the Yugoslav border if he were assured of the West's
immediate acceptance of his plan. He stated that otherwise Pella
would probably resign or be defeated on a vote of confidence, either
of which might result in Italy's withdrawal from NATO and an increase
in neutralist and extreme rightist influence.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Comment on Cambodian attitude toward Viet Minh:

 

 

 

 

Cambodian premier Penn Nouth stated
on 10 September that his government had ""no quarrel with com-
munism so long as it does not attempt to impose itself by force
on our people."" He also promised Viet Minh elements in Cam-
bodia that they would not be pursued if they returned to Vietnam.

 

Penn Nouth's attitude is entirely con-
sistent with the Cambodian view that the Viet Minh is a Vietnamese
problem which has to a small extent involved Cambodia; there are
perhaps as many as 1,000 regular Viet Minh troops in Cambodia.
The three Associated States have consistently maintained isola-
tionist attitudes with respect to each other. Cambodian and Laotian
troops are under no obligation to serve outside Cambodia and can-
not be expected to join in the fighting against the Communists in
Vietnam.

SOUTH ASIA

Comment on Communist victory in Nepalese elections:

| The unexpected Communist victory in

the 9 September municipal council elections in Katmandu, capital
and only important city of the strategic border state of Nepal,

indicates greater voting strength and a greater degree of cohesion
than the Nepalese Communist Party has previously demonstrated.

 

 

The Communists ran as individuals rather
than as members of their party, which is banned, and won six of
the 18 seats in the council, more than the number won by any party.
With the probable help of the National Congress Party, which won
four seats, they will be in a position to control the council on many
issues.

It is likely that both Prime Minister
Koirala and the Indian government will take steps to curtail Com-
munist influence in the council, though their ability effectively to
suppress it entirely is doubtful.

'FAR EAST

Popular pressure demands Japanese government act in fisheries dispute:

 

 

Japanese fishing interests are continuing strong -
demands that the government take positive meas-
ures in the Japan-South Korea fisheries dispute,
i ncluding a request for United States assistance

 

under the US-Japan Security Treaty, according to the American embassy
in Tokyo. The government now hopes that an early meeting of fishery
representatives from both countries can reach an interim compromise

- that will pave the way for a resumption of official negotiations.

The embassy comments that there is little pros-
pect of agreement as the Japanese will refuse to recognize the '""Rhee
line,"" which the South Koreans apparently consider a prerequisite to an
agreement. Consequently, mounting political pressure may force the
Japanese government to take retaliatory measures,

.Comment: Incidents arising from South Korean
actions to forbid Japanese fishing operations in international waters ad-
jacent to Korea and any Japanese retaliatory measures would probably
stimulate popular Support for Japan's rearmament,

3. Chinese mainland harvests considerably below last year's:

25X1A

25X1A

 

 

The American consul general in Hong Kong
believes that Chinese mainland grain pro-
duction in 1953 will be considerably smaller
than last year. The Chinese Communist
press has stated that the autumn harvests

 

 

in certain districts declined this year due to drought and flood, and
refugees and travelers from the mainland continue to confirm that
agricultural difficulties in both Manchuria and China proper were
greater this summer than in 1952,

- Comment: Government income, a large
part of which is requisitioned grain, will probably decline as a re-
Sult of the poor 1953 harvest, and therefore the construction program
might have to be curtailed, Despite the prospect of widespread food
shortages next spring, Peiping will probably continue to meet its
commitments to export large quantities of rice and vegetable oilseeds,
because of its need for foreign exchange,

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Burmese oppose resumption of Bangkok talks:

 

The Burmese ambassador in Bangkok told
an officer of the American embassy on 18
September that there was no purpose in re-
opening the four-power negotiations for the
evacuation of Chinese Nationalist troops from Burma. He indicated
that further discussion should be conducted on the '""diplomatic level""
and suggested New York as the most suitable site.

Comment: The Burmese government
regards the last-minute Nationalist acceptance of the committee's
evacuation plan as an opportunistic maneuver to impress the UN.

The Burmese withdrawal from the Bangkok
talks provides the Nationalists with their main defensive argument
in the General Assenibly debate on Burma's complaint. The Taipei
radio has already blamed the Burmese for the breakdown of nego-
tiations and insinuated that they acted under the influence of the

. Soviet bloc.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Israeli military activity reported along Egyptian border:

 

On 15 September twenty armed Israelis

with military communications equipment

entered the El Auja demilitarized neutral

zone cn the Egyptian-Israeli border (see 25X1
map, p. 6),

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Israelis reportedly occuplied

 

 a defensive position near Birein within the neutral zone and informed

a UN Mixed Armistice Commission observer that they had orders to
remain the entire day.

At least two weeks earlier a new Israeli
tent settlement had been established on Hill 311 near the neutral
zone. In the past two weeks Israeli troops have made almost daily
armed incursions into the neutral zone and attacked Arab bedouin
settlements. Moreover, the insistence of UN observers that the
Israelis leave the zone has apparently been ignored.

 

this 25X1
activity is apparently a deliberate move on the part of the Ben-

Gurion government to gain control of the El Auja zone, which is

believed to have sufficient water resources to sustain several 25X1
Israeli settlements. | the Israelis

may be taking advantage of Egypt's domestic troubles to gain their
objectives in the border area. :

GENERAL

German prisoners reported shipped to USSR after June riots:

 

 

 

 

25X1

 

prisoners from East Germany were
seen headed east in trains and trucks
from various points in Poland within

 

 

a few weeks after the 17 June German riots. On 8 July a long
train loaded with Germans under armed guard was reportedly
observed and there were indications that it was going to the USSR.
Two trains, each with about 1,500 German prisoners, were seen
on 15 July, and on 24 July a train of 12 boxcars with German
prisoners was seen.

 

25X1

 

 

 

lit is possible that
ooviet authorities have removed to the USSR many of those arrested
after the demonstrations, perhaps to prevent their release if new
riots should break out centered around East German prisons.

' SOVIET UNION

Purge of Georgian leaders eliminates Beria associates:

 

 

The actions of the Georgian Central

 

Committee at a plenary session on 20 September suggest that

the meeting was called solely for the purpose of eliminating

Beria associates from the republic's party and government.
All-Union party secretary N. N. Shatalin was sent from Moscow
especially to attend the meeting. The first secretary of the party
was replaced, and a new Central Committee Buro elected; a sub-
sequent government decree removed the chairman of the Council
of Ministers. Virtually all of Beria's former associates have now
been replaced.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Special American aid asked for Iranian army:

 

 

 

The shah proposed to Ambassador Henderson
on 18 September that the United States give
Iran additional fimancial aid to increase ihe
salaries of the noncommissioned officers

 

 

and low-ranking commissioned officers as well as to improve the
housing for the armed forces. The next day Minister of Court Ala
told Henderson that the army needed about $1,000,000 monthly to
carry out this program.

Comment: Poor pay and inadequate hous-
ing have long created low army morale. The shah apparently plans
to rely heavily on the army for support in the future and is trying to
give priority to improving its living conditions.

Shah favors ""supervised' elections for IranianMajlis:

 

 

 

Ambassador Henderson reports that the
shah believes it would be dangerous to
hold new Majlis elections before the
government has proved to the people

 

 

that its program is successful. If new elections become necessary,
the shah considers that they should be '""'supervised.""

The shah also stated that if the elections
failed to produce a ''good Majlis,' he would dissolve it and exercise
dictatorial powers until improved condltlons made it possible to
hold elections again. :

Comment: Without Majlis participation,
the present government invites popular opposition.

Rigged elections are usual in Iran. The
army, over which the shah is now exerting more direct control,
could be an important factor in obtaining the election of deputies
who would support the regime.

UN official expected to order Israel to drop plans for diverting
Jordan River:

 

 

Aides of General Bennike, chief of staff
of the UN Truce Supervision Organization,
are certain that he will request Israel to
stop its efforts to divert the upper Jordan
River near the Syrian border. According

 

 

to the American consul general in Jerusalem, Bennike's decision
has not been announced but has been telegraphed to UN headquarters
in New York.

Comment: Syria has threatened to take
the issue to the UN Security Council if Israel does not cease this
activity, which it began about three weeks ago.

7. Field Marshal Montgomery recommends reducing Greek army:

 

 

On 21 September Field Marshal
25X1A )
Montgomery, in separate conversations
with the Greek minister of defense and
the prime minister, recommended re-
duction of the Greek army from ten to six divisions in the interest
of a stronger economy. Montgomery reportedly will make a similar
recommendation to the Turkish government.

 

 

 

Ambassador Cannon in Athens fears that
Montgomery's recommendation may cause widespread popular
pressure for reduction of the armed forces.

 

25X1

 

 

 

Montgomery's views were made public
the same day that he spoke to the defense minister and the prime
minister. He is reported to have argued publicly that in peacetime
a country is better off with a few well-equipped army divisions than
with a large number of understrength divisions,

WESTERN EUROPE

8. British again press for revision of proposed Austrian note to
Moscow:

 

 

According to the American embassy in
25X1A London, the Foreign Office now considers
it extremely urgent for the Western powers
to persuade the Austrians to modify the
text of their proposed new note to Moscow. Foreign Office officials
believe that the present draft implies that Austria has withdrawn

support from the short treaty in response to Soviet insistence,
and that it would be certain to lead to a new Soviet note charging
that the West alone is responsible for blocking the treaty.

Comment: The draft Austrian note
states that ""if the Soviet Union refuses to discuss the short
treaty,"" Austria will no longer support it. The draft fails to
mention that the Western powers in their notes of 17 August
agreed that the short treaty would not be introduced for con-
sideration at the meeting of the treaty deputies then proposed
for 31 August.

. Previous Western efforts to revise
the proposed note, which will be reviewed by the competent
parliamentary committee on 23 September, have been brushed
aside by the Austrian government.

said the Communists
apparently want to show that they can rebuild the north before
the United States can rebuild the south, He believes further
that the Communists want a political conference for propaganda
purposes to cover their frantic revhabilitatiori efforts.

 

 

 

Comment: Reports from an NNSC

 team state that Communist rail shipments into North Korea have

been stepped up, indicating that Moscow may have begun to imple-
ment its billion-ruble aid program for North Korean reconstruction.
Members of the neutral nations teams are permitted to make only
limited inspections and have not been able to determine whether the
materials arriving thus far are for military purposes or industrial
rehabilitation.,

His government, Jamali told US ambassador

 

 

Berry, is just as eager as its predecessor for favorable American
action. The new Iraqi chief of staff has expressed the same hope to
the US military attache,

Comment: Jamali favors planning with
the United States for the defense of the Middle East. Iraq wants to ,
carry out a four-year army expansion program, under which the army
would serve as a British corps in the event of war, with the mission
of defending the northern and eastern fronticrs of Iraq.

25X1A GENERAL

Soviet official hints at tactics on four-power conference:

 

 

 

A Soviet official in Bern expressed the

opinion that the Soviet Union was unlikely

to take part in a four-power conference unless
a five-power conference were called simul-

 

 

taneously, according to the Swiss legation in-Washington,

: Comment: The anticipated Soviet note on
the projected Lugano conference may well contain a new stalling
device in specifying that the two conferences, as proposed in the
Soviet note of 28 September, be held simultaneously.

: Ambassador Bohlen, on the other hand,
has suggested that the reply might propose a preparatory meeting
of deputy foreign ministers similar to the 1951 Palais Rose conference.
Thé USSR could stréeteh out sich a meeting indefinitely by means
such as proposing agenda items for a five-power conference on
'""lessening international tensions,"" even though there is little
difference between the latest Western and Soviet proposals for a
broad agenda on Germany at a four-power meeting,.

Czechoslovakia offers to make concessions to increase trade with
Austria:

 

 

 

An official of the Czech Ministry of
Foreign Trade proposed to the Austrian
legation in Prague on 8 October that
negotiations for a new trade agreement

 

 

be undertaken in November. The Czech government is now repre-
sented as ready to adopt measures ""more acceptable to Austria'
in order to improve trade relations,

Comment: This is the first indication
that a Satellite government is ready to make concessions on its
own initiative in order to increase trade with the West in accordance
with the new Orbit economic policy. In the past, concessions by
Orbit negotiators were made only to improve their bargaining
position,

In line with current Soviet trade policy,
Czechoslovakia may agree to decrease its demand for strategic
goods and to import more raw iron and steel and consumer goods
from Austria., Austrian firms have attempted to increase their
exports to the Orbit of some of these latter items, which are too
high-priced to sell readily in Western markets, Czech intransigence
on these points caused the negotiations preceding the current agree-
ment to drag on for more than half a year.

FAR EAST

Indian official says NNRC may hold Korean POW's indefinitely:

 

 

Ambassador Chakravarty, India's
ranking adviser on the Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission, told
Ambassador Dean on 1 November

that the NNRC must continue to hold

 

 

nonrepatriated prisoners if the political conference has not yet
convened by 23 January, the date on which it is scheduled to
have completed debate on the prisoner question.

: Comment: Under the truce terms, the
conference is supposed to consider the prisoner question from
approximately 25 December to 23 January, with the NNRC re-
taining custody of the prisoners. In the following 30 days the
NNRC is to declare the prisoners released from prisoner to
civilian status and assist them to go to neutral nations, following
which the commission is to dissolve itself.

. American officials are already on
record as saying the prisoners must be released on 23 January
whether or not the conference has discussed the problem. This
date virtually coincides with the end of the 90-day period in
which Rhee has promised not to obstruct the truce.

5. French operation in sduth Tonkin fails to bring strong Viet Minh

The French have been disappointed in the
Viet Minh reaction to their operation in
outhern Tonkin, according to the American
army attache in Saigon. He believes the
French Are not occupying terrain really critical to the Viet Minh,
and that the latter are unlikely to attack them in the heavily entrenched
defensive positions they have set up. :

He reports that of two enemy divisions against
which the operation was directed, one is continuing to infiltrate the delta.
and the other is continuing its training program.

Comment: Contrary to press reports, the
French operatlon is believed to have had little effect on the Viet Minh's
offensive capabilities. The army attache previously described current
French tactics of building a strong defensive position and hoping for
an enemy attack as reminiscent of the tactics of Navarre's defense-
minded predecessor, General Salan,

Burma blames Nehru for its rice surplus:

 

 

 

In a further conversation with Ambassador
Sebald regarding the disposal of Burma's
rice surplus, cabinet minister Kyaw Nyein
stated that India's failure to purchase

 

 

600,000 tons of rice, set aside at Nehru's personal request at the
expense of other traditional buyers, had caused bitter feeling in
the Burmese cabinet. He stated that this rice forms a large part
of the present surplus.

Kyaw Nyein indicated that one of the
attractions of a Chinese Communist offer to buy Burmese rice
was that it provided an opportunity to break Burma's dependence
on India. He implied, moreover, that he could delay a final
agreement with Peiping for only about 20 days.

GENERAL
1. Finnish vessel reportedly delivering tanks to Communist China:
while in Gdynia he observed
trucks, trailers and tanks being loaded
aboard the Finnish vessel Korsholma for

China.

Comment: This is the second recent
report that Finnish vessels under Satellite charter are delivering
arms to Communist China. In October the Herakles was observed
unloading six-inch guns from Gdynia in Canton's port of Whampoa.
The Korsholma left Suez on 30 October for China.

In most cases the terms of Finnish
charters to the bloc exclude transport of arms and ammunition,
but some shipowners are willing to overlook the charter limita-
tions in view of the profitable nature of this trade.

SOVIET UNION

2. Comment on 24 November Pravda article:

 

 

 

As a possible forerunner of a new Soviet
propaganda emphasis, a 24 November Pravda article points to ""normal
relations' and ""cooperation"" with the United States as a major condi-
tion for easing international tension. The timing suggests it may be
intended to encourage British and French pressure at Bermuda for a
more conciliatory attitude regarding the Soviet position on such issues
as China's admission to the United Nations.

 

Consistent with long-standing propaganda,
however, the article alleges that Secretary Dulles is not interested
in normalizing relations and maintains that ""the activity of subverting
peaceful states is inseparably bound to the aggressive policy of US
ruling circles.""

25X1A

 

Continued adherence to this anti-American
theme and the omission of a specific proposal which might lead to co-
operation suggest that the Pravda article on """"normal Soviet-American
relations' is simply a new turn of an old wheel.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Viet Minh may intend thrust into Laos:

 

 

 

The concentrating of Viet Minh regular
forces in the Vinh area of northern Annam
as a result of current troop movements
places the enemy in an excellent position

to move southwestward into Laos to threaten

 

 

3.
25X1A
4,

French communications with Saigon along the Mekong River, according
to the US army attache in Saigon (see map, p. 5).

One regiment of the 304th Division has
already reportedly moved southward from Thanh Hoa to join the 325th
Division at Vinh, while a regiment and the headquarters element of the
320th Division have movedfrom Phu Nho Quan to Thanh Hoa.

 

 

25X1

 

 

The southward movement of elements of the
304th and 320th Divisions may reflect a reallocation of defensive re-
sponsibilities in the Thanh Hoa-Vinh base area, which would become
necessary if the 325th Division were committed to offensive action in
Laos.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Compensatipn reportedly major Libyan consideration in US treaty

 

negotiations:

 

 

The amount of compensation is the principal 25X1
Libyan consideration in negotiating the base
agreement with the United States,

2. New type of Soviet jet observed: 25X1

 

 

 

 

25X1 recently observed
two jet alrcraft of a new type at Kazan airfield
about 450 miles east of Moscow. These air-
craft were apparently twin-jet light bombers
with an over-all length of approximately 65
feet, and had swept-back wings and tail section,

 

 

 

 

Comment: The Soviet Union has been ex-
pected to develop an aircraft to replace the IL-28 and TU-14 jet light
bombers, The swept wings indicate that the new plane has higher pre-
formance capabilities than the older types and is therefore less vulnerable
to interception,

4, Ambassador Bohlen comments on Soviet note:
25X1 Ambassador Bohlen believes that the

Soviet note of 26 November represents

an important shift in the tactical handling
of the German question and the general
subject of negotlations with the West. There is no reason to believe,
however, that the basic Soviet policy of supporting the East German
regime has changed. World reaction to the note of 3 November has
apparently convinced the USSR that its refusal to confer was more
disadvantageous to its position than the risks of a discussion on
Germany.

Bohlen believes that the stated intention to
call for a five-power conference is a sop to the Chinese, who must
have been displeased by the four-power meeting proposal.

&

Comment: The note represents a tactical
shift on Germany but no retreat from the familiar Soviet demand for
Chinese participation in a conference. Verbose arguments to support
this demand and the insistence on discussing bases and disarmament
would probably be used to forestall substantive discussion of the German
issue in a four-power meeting.

FAR EAST

5. Rhee repudiates agreement on observers at political conference:

 

25X1 According to Ambassador Briggs, President
Rhee now says that at the 26 November cabinet
meeting he did not authorize inviting nonvoting
observers to the Korean political conference,
Briggs fears that the South Korean government may issue a public state-
ment opposing such participation very soon.

 

 

 

Comment: Ambassador Dean had reported
complete oral agreement in the 26 November meeting by both Rhee and
the cabinet on inviting observer nations and on authorizing him to make
the proposal to the Communists, He notes that Foreign Minister Pyun
gave a statement to that effect to the press on 27 November,

It appears that Rhee has again resorted to his
familiar tactics of backtracking on agreements already made.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA
7. Comment on victory of pro-Egyptian party in Sudanese elections:

The National Unionist Party's decisive
victory in the Sudanese elections is a serious setback to the inde-
pendence movement in the Sudan and a triumph for the supporters
of union with Egypt. The victory is also a direct reflection of the
strength of the anti-British sentiment.

While Britain will continue to furnish
much of the apparatus for governing the country during the three-
year transition period to independence, the elections make it clear
that it will experience increasing obstructionism from the pro-
Egyptian faction,

Cairo may now be expected to expand its
activities in the Sudan aimed at promoting union with Egypt. The
vote, however, may have been more anti-British than pro-Egyptian,
and the National Unionist Party, a newly formed coalition lacking
experienced leadership, may not hold together, 25X1

French reaction to Ho Chi Minh's statement on negotiations:

French government spokesmen and the
French press have been very circumspect in their reaction to the
ostensible peace feeler from Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh, Premier
Laniel withheld comment until the cabinet could discuss the subject.
Laniel stated in last week's foreign policy debate, however, that France
was willing to accept any offer from the ""adversary"" to negotiate, and
assured the National Assembly that he intended at Bermuda to seek
general pacification of Asia through negotiations.

Within the National Assembly there is now

little organized opposition to the basic concept of a negotiated settlement.

Although the French public will recognize as propaganda Ho's alleged

reference to American pressure to ratify EDC, the mere announcement 25X1
of the ""offer' will hurt ratification prospects. Anti-EDC foices will

seize on Ho's statement as further evidence that the geneial relaxation

of East-West tension makes German rearmament unnecessary.

SOVIET UNION

Bohlen sees genuine Soviet interest in reducing tension:

 

 

Ambassador Bohlen believes that the Western
note of 16 November proved to the Kremlin
that it had failed to divide the West on the
question of Chinese Communist participation

 

 

in a conference and that as long as the Soviet Union continued to insist
on this condition it could have no important contact with the leading
Western powers. He states that most foreign observers in Moscow
consider that the present regime genuinely desires to avoid complica-
tions and adventures in its foreign relations while it is carrying out
new programs in agriculture, consumers' goods and trade, both in the
USSR and the Satellites.

The ambassador points out that the
26 November note suggests, for the first time since the war, that
the Eastern European nations and their relationship to European
security are suitable subjects for discussion. He thinks the ref-
erences to European security in the note and in subsequent propa-
ganda foreshadow Soviet proposals at the four-power conference
for a European regional security plan designed to limit German
rearmament with the ultimate aim of squeezing the United States
out of Europe.

FAR EAST

North Korea receiving railway equipment from USSR:

 

 

 

According to a broadcast in Korean from
Pyongyang, 546 carloads of rails, concrete
and other railway and construction equipment

 

 

had been received from the Soviet Union by
20 November under the billion-ruble aid program. Much of this material
is being used to reconstruct trunk rail lines in North Korea.

Comment: This is the first indication from

- Pyongyang that substantial amounts of railway equipment are arriving

from the USSR under the Soviet-North Korean agreement signed in Sep-
tember. Along with the reconstruction of metallurgical and hydroelectric
plants, railroads are probably being given a priority because they are
vital to the rehabilitation and further development of North Korea.

Stalemate in negotiations with Korea threatens moderate Japanese stand:

 

 

The continued delay in resumption of negotia-
tions with South Korea in the dispute over
fisheries and property claims threatens to
discredit the Japanese Foreign Ministry's

 

 

policy of conciliation toward the Rhee government, according to Ambas-
sador Allison. He notes that if the prospects for an early settlement
continue to recede, the advocates of forceful retaliation against Korea
will assume control of Japanese policy.

Allison comments that the Japanese
public and the fishing interests believe that the good offices of the
United States will provide for an early resumption of negotiations.
He notes, however, that Foreign Ministry officials are becoming
increasingly alarmed by the lack of progress.

Comment: Prime Minister Yoshida on
2 November postponed taking cabinet-approved retaliatory measures
against South Korea for its seizures of Japanese fishing vessels in
view of America's willingness to lend its good offices and provide
observers at future talks. Rhee has indicated, however, that he
feels no compulsion to modify his attitude.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Chinese Nationalists announce end of evacuation from Burma:

 

 

A Chinese Nationalist spokesman has
informed the three-power committee

in charge of the evacuation of Chinese
troops from Burma that the withdrawal
will end on 8 December. The American
embassy in Bangkok points out that by
then 1,800 troops and 225 dependents
will have been evacuated instead of the
2,000 troops with arms and ""several

 

 

hundred' dependents originally promised by Taipei.

The Burmese cease-fire agreement 25X1
terminates on 15 December. |

 

 

 

 

 

Comment: Scarcely any arms have been
brought out by the evacuees. An estimated 10,000 Chinese troops remain
in Burma. The remaining forces apparently now call themselves the ""Anti-
Communist United Forces of Free Peoples in Southeast Asia,",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001300730001-6,/meta-54400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1953

States assures him it will resume the fighting if the conference
fails to achieve withdrawal of the Chinese Communists from Korea
after 90 days. Rhee implied, however, that he might settle for a
promise of logistic and materiel support if the United States were
unwilling to fight.

Briggs believes Rhee is motivated by a
deep-rooted suspicion of attempts to secure unification through
negotiations, a belief that the Communists have no intention of
relinquishing North Korea, and concern over increasing Chinese
influence there. Rhee apparently believes that the talks would
merely give the Chinese time to consolidate in North Korea.

Comment: On his return on 29 November
from talks with Chinese leaders in Taipei, Rhee repudiated an agree-
ment made three days before to invite nonvoting observers to the

conference.

in Paris for truce negotiations with the Viet Minh. Dejean said

that at a ministerial meeting in Paris, no one challenged his view
that an armistice is impossible except on terms which would allow
the Communists to take over Vietnam. He added that in view of
this fact, any future French government, even one headed by Pierre
Mendes-France, would have to continue the fight on the basis of the
Navarre plan.

Comment: Despite French desires to
end the Indochina war, the government is unwilling to follow up Ho's
""offer' at least until the results of the Navarre plan become evident
and until the possibility of five-power talks has been explored.

The Mendes-France program, as outlined

to an American embassy official in Paris on 17 June, would not be
incompatible with continued prosecution of the war,

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Egypt believed preparing campaign to spread neutralism among Arab
states:

 

 

 

The Iraqi ambassador in Cairo believes
that Egypt requested the postponement of
an Arab League meeting until 9 January

in order to prepare a campaign to pressure

 

 

the Arab states into a neutralist position. He told Ambassador Caiffery
of his concern over the present neutralist trend in Egypt's foreign policy.

Caffery in reporting this also notes that the
Egyptian press hints at possible recognition of Communist China and
Albania.

Comment: Egypt will push its neutralism,
which has grown since mid-November and was particularly publicized

on the eve of the Bermuda conference, if it becomes convinced that
there is no hope for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement on the Suez issue.

Eden feels further concessions to Egypt impossible:

 

 

 

Foreign Secretary Eden during the Bermuda
conference stated that for domestic political
reasons Britain can make no further conces-
sions to Egypt on the Suez issue. He said

 

 

that some compromise might be possible regarding future availability
of the base, but not over the issue of uniforms for British technicians.

Eden also said that early extension of Ameri-
can financial aid to Egypt would be ""extremely serious' in its effect on
Anglo-American relations.

Comment: Eden was referring to his diffi-
culties with the group of about 35 Conservative '""rebels' in Parliament
whose leader has stated that the Churchill government is doomed if it
yields on the uniform issue.

. -Political crisis again threatens Libya:

 

 

 

American minister Villard reported on

9 December that Prime Minister Muntasser
left Benghazi on the eve of the opening of
Parliament after King Idriss failed to grant

 

 

a written commitment that he would reduce ''palace meddling"" in politics.
Villard commented that Muntasser's departure has left the federal govern-
ment in complete confusion, but that Parliament is expected to open as
scheduled on 10 December without the prime minister.

Comment: Muntasser's sudden departure

from Benghazi suggests thaf relations between King Idriss and his prime
minister have again reached a critical stage.

GENERAL .

Reported Soviet offer to discuss military sales to India:

Soviet ambassador Menshikov's reported
offer to discuss the sale of military equipment to India shouild the
United States decide to arm Pakistan is probably a Soviet propaganda
maneuver. The Soviet ambassador reportedly indicated that the
materiel could be imported under the terms of the Indo-Scoviet agree-

""ment of 2 December.

This offer is unlikely to be seriously con-
sidered by India, which can foresee the obvious problems of continued
replacement, maintenance, and training, as well as the effect accept-
ance would have on its policy of neutrality.

Neutral report on Korean prisoners may intensify Indian demand for
UN discussions:

 

 

The American embassy in London reported
on 23 December that the Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission's report on Korean
prisoners might ''renew'"" Indian pressure for

todianship ends on 23 January.

Comment: Prime Minister Nehru's sugges-
tion on 23 December that early General Assembly discussions be held
on the Korean prisoner issue appears to confirm the embassy's observa-
tion. India probably recognizes, however, that the UN can do",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001400100001-4,/meta-54400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1953

FAR EAST

Inadequate Japanese defense budget nears final cabinet decision:

 

 

Barring last minute changes, top Japanese
officials are expected to submit to the cabi-
net for final decision on 12 January a draft
1954 defense budget described by the Ameri-

 

 

can embassy as 'disappointing' and ""inadequate."""" The draft calls for
total defense appropriations of 138.4 billion yen (about $384,000,000)
during the next fiscal year, as compared with ""minimum"" American
recommendations of 155 billion yen (approximately $430,000,000).

The budget limits the increase in Japanese
ground forces to 24,000 for 1954, 6,000 less than what the United States
regards as an acceptable minimum.

Comment: Foreign Minister Okazaki told
Ambassador Allison on 28 December that the budget would not fall far
short of the figure of 155 billion yen suggested by the United States, as
compared with 123.4 billion expended in fiscal 1953,

Indians impressed by Chinese Communist construction program:

 

25X1A

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25X1
were greally impressed 25X1
by the tremendous amount of construction,
rebuilding and cleaning up in Communist China.

 

They expressed the view that Peiping is
seeking a position of real independence vis-a-vis the Soviet Union and
would welcome the normalization of relations with the United States.

Comment: Peiping's construction program
similarly impressed several non-Communist diplomats who were given
a tour of Manchuria last month. These tours are part of the Chinese
effort to exploit ""neutralist' sentiment, especially in the Far East.

There is no evidence of Chinese eagerness for diplomatic relations
with the United States.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Philippine vice president to visit Indonesia:

 

 

Vice President Garcia of the Philippines
will pay an official visit to President Sukarno
of Indonesia during January,

25X1

 

| The

 

American embassy in Manila believes it reasonably certain thal Garcia

will invite a military mission to visit the Philippine armed forces and

will suggest that Sukarno appoint a small number of cadets to the Philip- 25X1
pine Military Academy. :

Comment: Ambassador Cumming in Djakarta
has reported that the Indonesian foreign minister recently expressed
great admiration and respect for Magsaysay. He readily agreed to the
ambassador's suggestion that, in certain fields, Indonesia might benefit
from employment of Philippine technical advisers.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Iran again requests $25,000,000 loan from Export-Import Bank:

 

 

Foreign Minister Entezam asked Ambassador
Henderson on 5 January whether Iran could
soon receive the $25,000,000 Export-Import
Bank loan which has been pending for two

 

 

years. Entezam said funds are urgently needed for economic develop-
ment programs which cannot wait for renewed oil revenues.

He argued that Iranian good will has been
sufficiently demonstrated to convince the United States and the Export~
Import Bank that granting of the loan will not diminish eagerness to
settle the oil dispute.

GENERAL

Yugoslavia will reportedly make strong demands at London talks on
Trieste:

 

The Yugoslav government will remain firm
during the forthcoming London talks in its 7
demands for access to the free port of Trieste,

25X1

 

 

 

25X1

' 2.
25X1A

 

t Italian insistence on a con-

 

tinuous coastal strip from Monfalcone to Pirano would be ""unfortunate,""
and that Yugoslavia will insist on obtaining sovereignty over a corridor _
through Zone A to the sea, preferably at Zaule.

Although not in a position to finance the con-
struction of a port at Zaule, Yugoslavia feels it can use its control over
the area as a lever to ensure Italian guarantees of economic cooperation.

~ The Slovene minority question is also viewed as a major obstacle to

settlement.

Yugoslav leaders reportedly believe that the
American and British representatives at London will in. effect be acting
on behalf of Italy.

Comment: The United States, Britain, and
Yugoslavia, as the three occupying powers in Trieste, will meet in London
on 2 February to attempt to establish a realistic basis for negotiation of a
definitive Trieste solution.

This report indicates no significant change in
the Yugoslav position in the past three months. It is highly improbable
that any Italian government would accept a solution giving Yugoslavia
sovereignty over a corridor through Zone A. '

Afghanistan signs $3,500,000 credit agreement with USSR:

 

 

Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have signed

an agreement for the construction by Soviet
technicians during the next three years of

two grain warehouses, a flour mill, and a
bakery near Kabul. The costs will be covered
by a $3,500,000 credit at three percent interest,
which Afghanistan is to begin repaying in 1957
with cotton, wool, and oilseeds.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Technicians ready to survey Iran's oil installations:

 

 

The American embassy in London reported
on 4 February that a technical mission of

the oil consortium is ready to make a pre-
liminary survey of the Abadan refinery and

 

 

the Iranian oil fields if Tehran approves.

The group consists of four technicians from
the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and two each from the five American
companies;, Royal Dutch Shell, and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles.

The mission will not visit Tehran. It plans
to arrive at Basra in Iraq about 10 February and will fly from there to
the oil installations each day.

Comment: The Iranian government will
probably approve the survey, which is expected to provide the first
comprehensive and reliable report on the condition of the Abadan
refinery in nearly two years. The survey is necessary before the
consortium can reach a decision on operating and marketing.

GENERAL

French Foreign Ministry official wants early end to Berlin conference:

 

 

A French Foreign Ministry spokesman told
the American embassy in Paris on 5 February
that the principal question remaining at the
Berlin conference was how best to terminate

 

 

it. He expects the USSR to press for the establishment of expert
working groups on ""Germany, the Far East, disarmament, et cetera""
which would report to a future four-power ministerial meeting.

He recommends that the West suggest that.
diplomatic channels be used for the discussion of the first two topics
and that disarmament be handled in the United Nations. If progress
is made by such means, then the Foreign Ministers could meet again.

Comment: The disillusionment of the Paris
press with the Soviet position at Berlin may encourage the Foreign
Ministry to seek an early end to the conference. It is unlikely, how-
ever, that the French government will press for its termination until
satisfied that the secret discussions at Berlin offer no hope for an
acceptable solution in Indochina.

SOVIET UNION
Administration of Soviet metallurgical industry decentralized:
The establishment of Union-Republic
Ministries of Ferrous Metallurgy and Nonferrous Metallurgy is an
unprecedented departure from the traditional Soviet policy of admin-

istrative centralization of heavy industry and may reflect a decision
to give more emphasis to regionalized supervision.

25X1A

 

 

Metallurgy has always been among the
all-union economic ministries which control specific parts of the
economy directly without regard for internal administrative lines.
In contrast, union-republic ministries have a dual organization,
with the difficulties of coordination attendant on having the union
ministry in Moscow and republic ministries in each of the constitu-
ent republics.

This disadvantage may be outweighed,
however, by the possibility of stimulating regional areas of the
USSR to more rapid development, with policy-making less central-
ized in Moscow. This would be in line with recent decisions giving
individual industrial ministers greater administrative latitude.

 

25X1

25X1A

The two newly appointed ministers have

long been associated with former minister Tevosyan. Tevosyan

was promoted in December to deputy chairman of the Council of
Ministers and probably continues to exercise control over the
metallurgical complex. There is a possibility, however, that
Tevosyan's removal as titular head of the metallurgical industry
may be part of the political maneuvering connected with his current
dispute with MVD minister Kruglov over control of Dalstroi, the

 

Chief Directorate of Far Northern Construction.

 

 

 

25X1A
SOUTHEAST ASIA

Vietnam military chief critical of French air training:

 

 

General Hinh, chief of staff of the Vietnam-
ese armed forces, told an American officer
that he had turned over approximately 1,000
Vietnamese personnel to the French air force
for on-the-job training, but that they were

 

 

used Only for KP duty and as orderlies. Few received any training,
morale dropped and mass desertions occurred.

Hinh would like a United States mission
to train the Vietnamese air force. He would also welcome American
instructors for artillery and armored force training,

Comment: The Vietnamese have been
eager for American instructors but the French have consistently
opposed their use. General Navarre recently rejected an American
proposal that he train a Vietnamese combat squadron, and the Ameri-
can air attaché in Saigon recently reported that the French efforts to
train a native air force are not effective. ",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001400470001-4,/meta-54400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1954

GENERAL

Bidault beheves Sovxet weakness in Germany prevents agreement on

unity

 

 

According tq Foreign Minister Bidault, the
Western powers were wise to adopt the
position that a future German provisional
government should be free to assume what-
ever obligations of the two present regimes

 

 

25X1

it chose, since the weakness of the Soviet position in Germany pre-
vents Molotov from agreeing to this proposal. Molotov, he said,
could not ""sacrifice to the cause of .German unification' the weak
Soviet position in East Germany, which would be demonstrated and

confirmed by free elections.

Bidault added that the exposure of the insecure
Soviet position might eventually have repercussions throughout the
Satellites. He described the present situation in East Germany as one
born of the tensions that have ""developed during the preceding years
between the German population and the Soviet occupation,",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001400490001-2,/meta-52800,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1954

stressed the Communist threat to Asia, is

development is a major setback to the ultranationalistic force led by
Senator Recto, who can be expected to counterattack sharply, probably
in 2 manner designed to embarrass both Magsaysay and the United
States. :

Comment: Senator Recto has already
publicly denounced the Magsaysay statement for being """"watered down
to appease certain pressure groups.' Vice President Garcia, who is
also foreign minister, has announced that the Foreign Ministry would
continue to espouse the ""Asia for Asians"" doctrine.

Although friction between Magsaysay and
powerful Nacionalista leaders has been mounting for some time, the
divergence over foreign policy has made this the first significant test
of their respective strengths. The outcome will determine the extent
to which Magsaysay will be able to guide the policies of the Philippine
government.

French Assembly may demand talks with Viet Minh if Geneva conference
fails: '

 

 

 

According to the American embassy in Paris,
the recent Indochina debate in the French
National Assembly made it clear that unless
the Geneva conference produces tangible re-

 

 

sults, parliamentary pressure for direct negotiations with the Viet Minh
will be ""almost insurmountable."" The embassy states the government
""""obviously bought time in Indochina with the Geneva conference, but the
assembly only extended credit on a short-term basis.""

The embassy adds that the assembly's resolu-
tion, which states that France will be relieved of its obligations to the
Associated States if they repudiate any provision of the constitution rela-
tive to the French Union, could lead to failure of the current French-
Vietnamese negotiations.

Comment: The Vietnamese delegation now
in Paris will probably press for a bilateral treaty granting Vietnam
virtual independence, though within the French Union. In all likelihood
this would be acceptable to the Laniel government and presumably would
be feasible without constitutional revision.

An enlargement of Vietnam's powers
would tend to limit France's freedom of action in any negotiations
with the Viet Minh, but would not preclude French withdrawal.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA

Israel intensifies attack on US arms aid to Arab states:
2okl LTeASlLesS atla

 

 

The Israeli government and press have
intensified their campaign against American
arms aid to the Arabs as well as the inclu-
sion of Iraq in the Turkish-Pakistani pact,

 

 

according to Chargé Russell in Tel Aviv, Most of the Israeli editorials
have reacted against even ""token' arms deliveries to the Arab states.

Prime Minister Sharett, speaking before
the Knesset in his capacity as foreign minister, stated that Israel's
opposition to arming the Arabs ""is absolute as long as they continue
to wage a cold or not so cold war.""

Comment: Israeli opposition to possible

Iraqi participation in the Turkish- Pakistani agreement has become more
violent as the probability of such adherence increases.

Nasr anxious for early Suez settlement:

 

 

Colonel Nasr desires a settlement on the
Suez base issue as quickly as possible.

He is convinced he can persuade the Revolu-
tionary Command Council to accept his

 

 

formula providing for immediate availability of the base to the West

in the event of an attack on Turkey as well as on any of the Arab states.
Nasr is willing to include Turkey if the British will yield on the question
of uniforms for technicians remaining at the base.

Nasr has authorized Ambassador Caffery to
suggest that the British ambassador arrange a meeting next week between
Nasr and the British negotiators.

FAR EAST

Atomic test incident stirs up anti-Americanism in Japan:

 

 

Foreign Minister Okazaki fears that the recent
radiation incident may harm Japanese relations
with the United States, according to Ambassador
Allison. He told Allison on 21 March that his

 

 

government faces difficulties in the Diet because of opposition demands for

assurances that Japan's fishing areas, as well as coastal currents from the

central Pacific, will not become contaminated. He said questions-are also

being raised about America's right under international law to block off large
areas of the Pacific. '

Okazaki said that unless authoritative and satis-

SOVIET UNION

Bohlen sees possible threat to Khrushchev's position:

 

Ambassador Bohlen observes that the
""""continued agricultural shortcomings""
revealed in Khrushchev's 23 February
report to the central committee may
create a threat to his position. The report, made public on 21
March, blueprinted a grain expansion program apparently '""based
Oon new or more accurate data'' than were available in September.

 

 

 

Bohlen notes that Khrushchev must, in
the long run, accept the responsibility for the agricultural program.
The ambassador points out that Khrushchev, in his sharp criticism
of subordinates, may be attempting ""to unload on others as much
responsibility for the situation as possible.""

Comment: By belatedly adding a grain
acreage expansion scheme to the objectives set last autumn, the
Soviet leaders increased the strains on their already ambitious
program, and may well have opened up further possibilities for
dissension within the hierarchy.

Assignments of priorities and equipment
under the autumn plan were presumably based on the estimate that
the grain situation was relatively satisfactory. The new plan requires
the diversion of quantities of equipment and manpower earlier ear-
marked for other sectors of the Soviet economy. '

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Navarre more optimistic about Dien Bien Phu:

 

General Navarre is definitely more
optimistic about holding Dien Bien Phu
than a week ago, according to Commis-

 

 

sioner Dejean. Ambassador Heath reports

 

that the French commander is gratified by the American permission
to use C-119's for bombing. Navarre believes that massive napalm
attacks on Viet Minh positions would destroy forest cover and cause

- heavy personnel losses and some destruction of artillery.

GENERAL

Soviet officials sound out West on widening Geneva discussions:

 

 

During a discussion of the prospects for

the Geneva conference at the British
Foreign Office on 19 March, the first
secretary of the Soviet embassy in London
remarked that it would be difficult to confine
the Geneva discussions strictly to Korea and
Indochina, as those problems were closely
related to a number of others, for example

 

 

trade restrictions.

The chief of protocol of the Soviet Foreign
Ministry asked Ambassador Bohlen on 22 March whether it would be
possible to discuss at Geneva ""other questions apart from the two sub-
jects agreed on at Berlin'! He added that he was not thinking of ""Euro-
pean questions' or any additional formal agenda items, but merely the
possibility afforded by the conference for private discussions of general
questions.

Comment: Moscow probably will make
strong efforts to arrange private five-power meetings at Geneva to
discuss the three major topics outlined by Molotov at Berlin: reduction
of armaments, ""normalization' of relations among the great powers,
and conditions for the development of international trade.

GENERAL

China trade controls may be questioned at COCOM meeting:

 

 

Consideration of the China Committee
report at the Consultative Group meet-
ing next month may be used by some
members as an occasion for raising

 

 

questions on the China controls, according to American COCOM
officials in Paris. Japan, in particular, may question. the strin-
gency of restrictions applied to trade with Communist China as
compared to those applicable to Western exports to the Soviet
Union and the Satellites.

Comment: On 23 March the Japanese
COCOM delegate informed American officials in Paris that his
government felt that any relaxing of trade controls applied to the
Soviet bloc in Europe would ""automatically' raise the question of
the China controls. He contended that the possibilities for trans-
shipment to China rendered more stringent China controls ""point-
less.""

Favorable political developments at the
Geneva conference, or a strong trade bid there by China, would
likely increase sentiment in COCOM for relaxing controls on the
China trade.

USSR may raise European security plan at Geneva:

 

25X1A

 

4,

25X1A

A French Foreign Ministry spokesman
believes that the USSR's plan for European
security will continue to be the leitmotif of
Soviet foreign policy for several years.

He says that the French and British govern-
ments anticipate the USSR may again raise
the security plan at Geneva and that they are

 

 

preparing a flat rejection to any such approach.

The official agrees with Ambassador Bohlen
that the recent increase in Soviet emphasis on this plan in the press and
speeches is designed to undo Molotov's Berlin blunder of relegating the
United States to the role of observer, and to emphasize that the proposal
is meant to unite rather than divide Europe.

Comment: Communist propaganda since the
Berlin conference has sought to keep the Soviet plan before Western

public opinion and thus reduce active support of EDC to a point where
the scales will be tipped against ratification.

FAR EAST

South Korean generals advise Rhee against independent military action:

held on 23 March, top South Korean army
generals informed Rhee flatly that he could

not hope to unify Korea by unilateral military action. 25X1

Briggs believes the generals included
Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Yi Hyong-kun, army chief of staff
Chong Il-kwon, and 1st Army commander Paek Sun-yop. He cites
this as ""interesting confirmation' that top South Korean army offi~
cials are realistic in their appraisal of the military factors involved 25X1
in a drive north.

 

 

 

 

Rhee and his generals almost certainly
discussed the army's capabilities in the event it should be expanded
to 35 divisions, as demanded by Rhee as the price for South Korea's
attendance at Geneva. The generals' views may make Rhee less
adamant in his demands.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

6. New major attack on Dien Bien Phu expected within 10 days:

25X1A

25X1A

 

 

The French expect a new major Viet
Minh attack at Dien Bien Phu within

10 days, according to a report on 24
March from the American army attaché
at Saigon. Despite French clearing
efforts, Viet Minh troops still occupy
trenches within 300 to 500 yards of some
French positions and are continuing their
attempts to isolate the southernmost

 

 

strong point from the center.

Meanwhile, the American consul in Hanoi
reports | |that the first attempt at
saturation napalm bombing on 23 March brought promising results.
French-piloted C-119's and C-47's burned swaths three kilometers
long and one kilometer wide to the west and east of the central French
defenses.

 

 

Comment: A Communist intention to risk
further costly attacks at Dien Bien Phu is suggested by the continuing
preparations there and also by a Peiping broadcast of 24 March which
quoted a Viet Minh journal. The latter asserted that the current cam-
paign ushers in a new stage in the Indochina war, with the Viet Minh
army 'launching massive attacks against strongly fortified French
positions.""

Bao Dai favors creation of high war council:

 

 

 

Bao Dai told Ambassador Heath on 23 March
that he wanted to create a ""high war council
that would really contribute to winning the
war."" In this connection, he praised the
Vietnamese chief of staff, General Hinh, and
criticized Premier Buu Loc. Discounting the
desirability of creating a provisional assembly,
he carefully intimated that he himself might

 

 

take over the government.

A well-qualified French observer states,
meanwhile, that Buu Loc's government is incapable of gaining popular
support and that Bao Dai, recognizing this, may be forced to take
action shortly.

Comment: Bao Dai's remarks tend to
bear out a recent report that he favors the creation of a three-man
military dictatorship to include himself and General Hinh. Sucha
move might result in increased efficiency, but would inevitably stir
up popular discontent,

Right-wing Nacionalistas to demand abrogation of Philippine agreements

GENERAL

Soviet note seeks to accord special status to Communist China at Geneva:

 

25X1A

 

The Soviet reply of 5 April to the Western
aide memoire on administrative arrange-
ments for Geneva argued that the Berlin
agreement makes it clear that all five

 

 

2.

powers should participate '""on an equal basis'"" in the examination of
""all questions relating to the conference.""

The note also proposed, on the basis of the
Berlin agreement, that Chinese be an official language, along with
English, French and Russian, ""during the course of the whole confer-
ence.' It stressed that Korean should be an official language only during
the consideration of the Korean question.

Comment: This is the latest move in a
continuing Soviet effort since Berlin to confer on China a status equal
to the four sponsoring powers, or at least superior to that of the other
""invited powers.""

The insistence on China's participation
throughout the conference may foreshadow a Soviet demand at Geneva
that China be included in the negotiations on the composition and scope
of the discussion on Indochina.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Comment on Viet Minh reinforcements for Dien Bien Phu:

 

25X1A

 

Further indication of a Viet Minh intent

to take Dien Bien Phu regardless of cost

is the reported large-scale movement of
enemy reinforcements toward the battle
area. The number and arrival dates can-
not be accurately determined, but informa-
tion from French intelligence suggests that
close to 20,000 troops may now be en route.

GENERAL

1. French deem cease-fire in Indochina imperative:

25X1A

25X1A

 

After an unsuccessful appeal to Prime
Minister Churchill for British support

in Indochina, French ambassador
Massigli told Ambassador Aldrich in
London on 27 April that France had no
alternative but the immediate commence-
ment of negotiations for a cease-fire.

Dutch co-foreign minister Luns told
Ambassador Matthews at The Hague on
22 April that the French '""had as much as
told him"" that they would accept any face-

 

 

saving settlement on Indochina, even if it
meant that six months later the area ""would fall to Ho Chi Minh, ""

 

A high French Foreign Ministry official
admitted to Secretary Dulles at Geneva that partition of Indochina had
been considered by Paris. He said that his government was not seek-
ing a ""cease-fire''--described as a ""local laying down of arms. .. tan-
tamount to French surrender'--but an ""armistice, ' as in Korea, with
political and military safeguards. ",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001500410001-9,/meta-51400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1954

GENERAL

Comment on Vyshinsky's remarks to Japanese delegation in Moscow:

 

 

Soviet deputy foreign minister Vyshinsky's
statement to a Japanese Diet delegation that
the USSR hopes to establish formal diplomatic
relations with Japan ""as soon as possible' is
the most specific high-level Soviet pronounce-
ment of Moscow's intentions to improve rela-

 

 

tions with Japan.

Since Stalin's death, the Soviet Union has
returned more than 1,400 of an estimated 14,500 Japanese prisoners,
thereby making a gesture toward improved relations. It has recently
been using economic and cultural approaches as means of gradually en-
couraging the Japanese to move toward an accommeoedation with the Orbit.

Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, when
advised of Vyshinsky's remarks, reiterated that a peace treaty was a
prerequisite for expanding relations. There are indications, however,
that Japan is reappraising its foreign policy in the light of general Asian
developments and that sentiment for loosening ties with the United States
is growing. | |

 

 

COCOM agrees on major relaxation of strategic trade controls:

 

 

Revisions in the international export control
lists agreed on in the COCOM review of the
past three months will go into effect on 16
August. The controls on trade with Commu-

 

 

nist China will not be changed at this time, but will be discussed at an
early Consultative Group meeting.

Controls over exports of merchant ships
could not be agreed on by the Consultative Group and will be considered
again on 7 September. Although all COCOM countries are committed
to improved transit trade controls, a definite deadline for adoption has
not been set. Several delegates stressed that their governments would
be reluctant to adopt such controls unless they were applied to all
COCOM members.

Comment: The decisions of the Consulta-
tive Group will reduce the number of items on the export control lists
by about 50 percent. In addition several items will be subject to less
stringent controls.

The adoption of improved transit trade

~ controls has long been blocked by several COCOM countries, and their

commitment to adopt them is apparently not firm.

FAR EAST

Japanese fishing interests threaten to challenge Rhee line:

 

 

Japanese fishing interests warned the Ameri-
can embassy in Tokyo or 20 July that some-
thing must be done quickly to settle the

 

 

dispute with South Korea over the Rhee line.
They pointed out that President Rhee's visit to Washington was an oppor-
tune time for the United States to intervene in their behalf. - At the

same time, they are planning to launch full-scale operations within the
Rhee line, despite the risks, and will call on Japanese naval forces for
protection.

Comment: This appears to be primarily a
threatzdesigned to hasten American mediation. The Japanese govern-
ment opposes any resort to force, preferring to wait until Japanese
military power is sufficient to impress the Koreans with the desira-
bility of finding a solution.

The Japanese Foreign Ministry, meanwhile,
speculates that General Hull's return to Washington during Rhee's
visit may indicate among other things an American attempt to improve
Japanese-Korean relations.

SOUTH ASIA

Ceylon unlikely to join Southeast Asian security pact:

 

 

The present temper of the Ceylonese press,
parliament and public opinion makes it un-
likely that Ceylon would join a collective
security pact for Southeast Asia at this time,

 

 

according to Ambassador Crowe. Moreover, Ceylon's attitude toward
the pact would probably be neutral rather than favorable, and the possi-
bility that it might join later would depend largely on the attitudes of the
other Colombo powers. The government itself, however, is '""not un-
sympathetic.""

GENERAL

Ulbricht visit to Moscow may foreshadow new Soviet moves in Germany:

 

 

American officials in Berlin believe that the
publicly announced presence in Moscow of
East German deputy premier Ulbricht and
President Pieck may mean that high-level

 

 

25X1 K""

discussions are taking place, possibly on a Soviet-East German pact.

They believe a friendship pact to change the
status of Soviet troops to a ""protective force' would be consistent with
current Soviet policy, but that an Eastern European security pact in-
cluding East Germany would be unlikely until French intentions on EDC
become clear. Another possible agreement would grant East Germany
responsibility for negotiating German reunification.

American officials also believe it possible
that the visit by Ulbricht and Pieck may be laying the groundwork for
a Soviet-proposed international conference on Germany and European
security. '

Comment: Planning for an international
conference is the most likely subject of the current discussions, at
which former high commissioner Semenov is probably also present.
It is possible that French Communist leader Thorez, who left France
for Moscow on 16 July, is also participating in the discussions.

While details of a treaty between the USSR
and East Germany may be under discussion, there is not likely to be
any announcement of a security pact before an attempt is made to hold
another international conference. The Soviet Union will probably urge
that another conference grant considerable responsibility for unifica-

 

tion attempts directly to the East and West Germans. |

Comment on Soviet plan fulfillment for the first half of 1954:

 

 

 

Reversal of the declining trend of the past
several years in the growth of capital in-

is the most significant feature of the plan fulfillment report for the
first half of 1954 released on 22 July by the Soviet Central Statisti-
cal Administration.

Capital investment increased 14 percent
over the first half of 1953, as compared with a 4-percent increase in
1953 over 1952, Maintenance of this growth rate through 1955 will
permit achievement of the five-year target for capital investment.

Industrial labor productivity rose 7.5
percent over the first half of 1953, while the corresponding increase
from 1952 to 1953 was 6 percent. While this rate of growth will not
permit achievement of the five-year target forlabor productivity,
continuing above-plan increases in the size of the industrial labor force
made possible a 14-percent gain in gross industrial output during the
first half of 1954. This will ensure fulfillment of the 1955 output plan.
However, the output of pig iron, oil and fertilizer is below that neces-
sary to meet five-year goals. lLarge percentage increases were re-
ported in the output of a number of consumer durables.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

French official warns against Vietnamese bid for direct US aid:

 

 

 

Jacques Raphael-Leygues, French emissary
charged with studying the """"possibilities of
reinforcing"" the Vietnamese government,
told Ambassador Dillon in Paris on 5 August

 

 

that the chief aim of the Vietnamese authorities is to obtain American
aid directly rather than through the French He called this """"dangerous""
and ascribed it to ""oriental reasoning, '* which in this instance requires

~ that steps be taken to prepare for possible accommodation with the

enemy.

Pointing to the Chinese Nationalists who in
1948-1949 went over to the Communists with their weapons, he argued
that if the Vietnamese authorities had control of American supplies

- they would be able to '""buy amnesty' from the Viet Minh.

Comme:nt: The French have consistently

opposed Vietnamese requests for direct control of American-supplied

materiel. In the past the French have usually claimed that the Viet-
namese lacked the organization for effectively processing and utiliz-
ing this aid. '

Continued French control over such supplies
would considerably strengthen the French position at the expense of
the national government, a scarcely concealed French aim.

-Ho Chi Minh's prestige in south underscored:

 

 

 

 

 

Ahigh French civil official in Saigon informed
the American embassy on 5 August that 240
out of 250 employees of the leading Saigon
printing establishment would unhesitatingly

 

 

vote for Ho Chi Minh in a national election. The American embassy in

Saigon sees in this near unanimity of opinion a striking indication of

the current low prestige of the Vietnamese national government. Its
unpopularity with these Vietnamese, who are well above average in
terms of background, training and salary, is cited as a measure of
the difficulties to be encountered in rallying anti-Communist forces in
south Vietnam. 25X1A

Comment: The hlgh personal esteem
in which Ho Chi Minh has been held throughout Vietnam for almost
a decade is evidence primarily of the nationalistic fervor of the
people rather than of an ideological trend.

Increased number of Overseas Chinese students going to Communist
China:

 

 

 

 

during 25X1
the quarter ending 30 June, three times as

many Chinese between the ages of 12 and 25
left Malaya for Communist China as during
the same period last year.

 

 

 

 

 

 

young Chinese 25X1

 

 

are now leaving Thailand at the rate of 200
per month, a rate more than double that estimated for last year.

The American consulate general at Singapore
comments that the increase in student departures seems likely to
continue now that Communist China is .""at peace' in Korea and Vietnam,
and as Peiping expands its propaganda appeals to Overseas Chinese.

Comment: High school and university-
level education on the mainland holds great attraction for young Over-
seas Chinese because of the almost complete lack of equivalent
facilities. either in the countries of their residence or in Taipei.

It has beeh traditional for Chinese in South-

east Asia to return to China for study. Many of those doing so now
are expected to return to Southeast Asia as Communist agents.

Comment on the change of truce supervisors in Palestine:

25X1A to replace Denmark's Major General
Bennike--suggests that the move will not
improve the situation in Palestine.

 

 

The Arabs are unusually bitter in assail-
ing Bennike's removal as the result of """"Jewish pressure' and in
decrying the Jewish influence in the United Nations. They question
the continued objectivity of the UN Truce Supervision Organization
and urge the Arab states to boycott it. They may be initially cool to
General Burns. |

 

The Israelis, whom American observers on
the scene hold largely responsible for the present discredited con-
dition of the truce machinery, are restrained in their rejoicing over
Bennike's removal. The Israelis insist that with the appearance of
General Burns, there must also be a general housecleaning of the UN
staff in Palestine, and a new approach to the problem. Disturbed by
the Suez settlement, and the prospects of more Western aid to the
Arabs generally, Israel is likely to continue to be demanding and dif-
ficult in its relations with the UN truce apparatus, even though the
arrival of General Burns may result in an initial appearance of co-
operation.

5. Belgrade radio reports Balkan Alliance to be signed on 9 August:

25X1A The official Yugoslav radio reported on

7 August that nothing now stands in the

way of the signing of the Balkan Alliance,
which is scheduled for 9 August. The broadcast stated that the final
text of the alliance was agreed on at a meeting of the Greek, Turkish,
and Yugoslav foreign ministers on 7 August at Bled, Yugoslav1a

 

 

Comment: This broadcast, while not an
official government announcement, indicates that the three foreign
ministers have successfully resolved differences concerning the text

 

 

 

 

of the alliance which persisted as recently as 2 August, I 25X1

GENERAL

Comment on Molotov's bid to normalize relations with Japan:

 

 

Foreign Minister Molotov's statement of
11 September to a Japanese editor that the

 

 

time is ripe for a normalization of relations
with Japan is the highest-level move thus far in the current Commu-
nist psychological offensive aimed at reducing American influence in
Japan and bringing Tokyo into closer relations with the Orbit.

Initial Japanese Foreign Ministry reaction
to Molotov's statement has been one of skepticism. The government
has reiterated its position that Japan will respond to any Soviet pro-
posal only on the basis of the San Francisco Peace Treaty--a position
to which it is virtually bound, in any event, until April 1955,

' Since the Geneva conference, however, Japan
has become increasingly vulnerable to the Communist overtures, which
have included diplomatic gestures, trade talks, trade concessions, and
the exchange of cultural delegations. The Communists are expected to
continue their campaign of friendly gestures toward Japan, but the USSR
probably does not have any serious intention to negotiate a peace treaty

- 80 long as the Yoshida government remains in power.| |

FAR EAST

Yoshida seen likely to survive threat from new conservative

 

alliance:

 

 

Ambassador Allison believes that the
19 September agreement between con-
servative leader Hatoyama and Pro-
gressive Party president Shigemitsu to

 

 

form a new conservative party will not result in a sudden shift
of power prior to Yoshida's forthcoming world tour or during
his absence.

Hatoyama's """"defection' has been a
blow to Yoshida, but there has been no upsurge of press or popu-
lar support for the Hatoyama-Shigemitsu combine. Fear is
already being expressed among the Japanese that the alliance
will result in further splintering of the conservative forces.

Allison notes that the new development
appears to be part of a three-way struggle for control of Japan's
conservative forces among the pro-Yoshida Liberals, the advo-
cates of a single conservative party, and the Progressives and
Yoshida-hating Japan Liberals.

_ Comment: Yoshida and his associates
are counting heavily on his visit to the United States and other
Western nations to restore his and the party's declining prestige.
His conservative opponents are reviving the shipbuilding scandals
in an effort to embarrass him and possibly block his trip in much

the same manner the Socialists did early last summer.

Foreign Minister Okazaki informed
Allison on 16 September that, while Yoshida was beginning to
think of retirement, he would do so only if it could be arranged
""peacefully,"" and would resist any attempt to force him out pre-
maturely. The extreme factionalism among the conservatives
suggests that Yoshida's elimination would bring no more than
temporary political stability.

Hatoyama brought most of his dissident
Japan Liberal Party back into Yoshida's Liberal Party in
November 1953 and it is still uncertain whether he will again

lead his 27 followers in the Diet out of the party, thereby seri-
ously weakening Yoshida's position in the Diet.

South Korean army chief not consulted on anti-US statement

 

issued in his name:

 

 

Two top South Korean army officers in
whose names a statement criticizing
American Far Eastern policies was
issued on 17 September. have stated

 

 

they were unaware of its contents bofore the press published it.
The statement criticized the Neutral Nations Supervisory Com-
mission, the redeployment of American forces, and American
policies toward Japan.

Army chief of staff General Chong told
an American embassy officer that he and First Army commander
General Paek were informed several days before that some sort
of statement might be made, but were not told of its contents or
date of release. Ambassador Briggs believes that General Yi,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the third ""signatory,""
may have known about it in view of his willingness to be a mouth-
piece for the Rhee government.

The ambassador comments that the
incident is another example of the way Seoul's current anti-
American campaign is being conducted by President Rhee and
his immediate supporters.

Comment: The Chong-Paek-Yi release
was apparently issued in answer to a 17 September American
embassy statement pointing out that future American aid was con-
tingent on """"wholehearted' South Korean co-operation, and is part
of Rhee's campaign to influence the forthcoming United States-

South Korean economic and military talks in Seoul.

. Cambodia to serve as cadres among the
populace. He has told the American
ambassador that the number of troops
being evacuated is falling far below the
official Viet Minh estimates, and that
the evacuees are poorly armed.

 

 

 

According to reports reaching the Ameri-
can army attaché in Phnom Penh, the total number evacuated by
the deadline of 20 October may turn out to be less than 3,000, in
contrast to a generally anticipated figure of 5,000 or more.

_ Comment; At the time of the cease-fire,
approximately 8,000 regular and irregular Viet Minh troops were
25X1 [ disposed in small
units throughout central and southern Cambodia. The new reports
further substantiate earlier indications that the Viet Minh intends
to retain its military nucleus in Cambodia by concealing arms and
leaving underground cadres.

EASTERN EUROPE

3. Comment on release of purged Hungarian Communists:

 

Istvan Kovacs, first secretary of the
25X1A Budapest committee of the Communist
Party, announced on 13 October that the
party has been reinstating members who were ""falsely' impris-
oned by former leaders of the Hungarian security police. This
confirms earlier reports that the regime is releasing former
officials purged on grounds of ""national deviation.""

 

 

 

The Hungarian press announced recently
the return to public office of ex-politburo member and minister of

interior Kadar, and there have been reports that former foreign
minister Kallai and other officials purged in 1950 and 1951 have
been released from prison.

This apparent reversal of policy toward
""mational deviationists' is an attempt to obtain greater popular
and party support for the regime's current policies, by creating
the impression that Hungarian national interests are being given
priority over the interests of the USSR.

Kovac's charge that the Hungarian secu-
rity forces were responsible for these ''false' arrests bears a
marked resemblance to the reversal of the doctors' plot in the
USSR last year, and is no. doubt designed to give the public a
greater sense of security from arbitrary arrest.

WESTERN EUROPE

Comment on the London strike situation:

 

 

 

Complete paralysis of the port of London
and indications that the unofficial strike
-may spread to other British ports has
led the government to intervene in order

 

 

to maintain essential supplies and services. If the strike is not
settled by 19 October when Parliament opens, Minister of Labor
Monckton will announce that troops will be brought in on 21 Octo-
ber to unload ships.

There is growing evidence that the work
stoppage is directed by the same political agitators and Commu-
nist elements which have been able to exploit legitimate economic
grievances for political purposes several times since the war.
Arthur Deakin, head of the Transport and General Workers' union,
to which most of the dock and bus strikers belong, believes that
the wildcat strike is in retaliation for his support of German re-
armament at the recent Labor Party conference, and that it is a
general effort to stir up trouble over the nine-power agreements
on West Germany.

The Conservative government had previ-

ously avoided intervention on the advice of Deakin who hoped that
the strike would peter out. Monckton conveyed the government's
plans to Alfred Robens, Minister of Labor in the Attlee government,

who offered no objections. | |

GENERAL

Soviet official says Paris agreements ratification will leave

 

nothing to negotiate:

25X1

 

 

 

 

Soviet

deputy foreign minister Zorin recently
said to! |gra_ve1y and 25X1
pointedly: """"What wi ere be to nego-

 

 

 

 

tiate alter ratificalion of the Paris agreements?"" He added,
""There will be nothing to negotiate then.""

Zorin charged that the Western powers
did not want to negotiate either an Austrian or a German solutlon

because negotiations would ""disturb their plans.

Comment: Statements of this kind by
officials are designed to bolsler open Soviet propaganda, which
has consistently emphasized how difficult negotiation on European
questions would be after ratification of the Paris agreements,
but which has carefully avoided excluding future negotiations.
Soviet propaganda has said repeatedly that ratification would
prevent German unification ""for many years.' The most recent
Soviet note said ratification would """"complicate' the European
situation and ""undermine"" the possibility of settling European
problems, particularly Germany.

At the Moscow reception on 7 November,
after a discussion with the French ambassador on the Paris agree-

-ments, Khrushchev asserted: '""There is nothing to be done.

Malenkov replied: ""There is always something to be done.""

SOUTHEAST ASIA

Comment on prolonged Laotian political crisis:

former Laotian finance minister, to form
a new cabinet is not likely to bring an

end to the political crisis in Laos, which
is already of record length. Meanwhile,
the government is prevented from taking
adequate steps to counter Viet Minh
infiltration and subversion,

 

 

 

The crisis had its origin in dissatis-
faction with the Geneva settlement; it came into the open with the
assassination of the defense minister on 18 September. Premier
Souvanna Phouma's government resigned on 19 QOctober.

The prolongation of the crisis results
from a roughly even balance in the assembly between the old
guard, who have been associated with the French for a long
period, and the younger members, who are impatient with any
delay in cutting down French influence. To be installed in office,
a cabinet must have a two-thirds vote in the assembly.

Katay, who failed in an earlier attempt
to form a cabinet, represents the younger group. Although an
anti-Communist of long standing, he shares the view of most
Laotian leaders that the Pathet Lao are ""ot really Communists. ""

The American embassy in Vientiane
believes that the only solution to the crisis may be for Crown
Prince Savang to draft a cabinet. So far the crown prince has
been reluctant to stretch his constitutional powers in this manner.

3. Cambodian accuses French of undermining US position:

 

 

Ouk Chhoum, chief aide to the Cam-
25X1A bodian defense minister, told an Ameri-
can official in Phnom Penh on 17 Novem-
ber that the Cambodian desire for Amer-
1can military training is being frustrated by vigorous French
efforts to persuade the Cambodians to turn down the offer of an
American training mission. He said the French have threatened
to withdraw all military support, and have argued that the United
States cannot be counted on in a pinch and that the introduction

of American personnel would be frowned on by the International
Control Commission and the ""neutral' countries.

Comment on French-Tunisian efforts to obtain fellagha surrender:

 

 

The contemplated joint French-Tunisian
efforts to effect a surrender of the Tuni-
sian fellagha--quasi-military outlaws--

 

 

will result at most in a limited compli-
ance and may split the intemperate from the moderate nationalists.
This widely publicized compromise, however, may be the face-
saving formula necessary to hurdle the current crisis in the Paris
negotiations for Tunisian self-government.

A surrender by a token group could be
accepted by the French as re-establishment of authority. The main
body of the fellagha could then abandon the unequal struggle at
least for the time being. Those who surrender risk continuing
surveillance and later punitive action, despite proposed guaran-
tees. The concurrence of the nationalist Neo-Destour in this ar-
rangement invites rabid adherents of the party to disavow it and
to continue the struggle in their own manner.

The contemplated disarming of French
settlers, included in the new proposals, is a major concession
to Tunisian demands and will meet with intense and immediate
opposition in France as well as from French residents throughout
North Africa. In the unlikely event that any real attempt were
made to disarm the settlers, widespread violence would ensue,

GENERAL

Soviet leaders warn French ambassador of consequences of rati-
fication of Paris agreements:

 

 

 

 

In a two-hour discussion between top
Soviet leaders and French ambassador
Joxe following the 10 December celebra-
tion of the anniversary of the French-
Soviet treaty, Malenkov emphasized
that Soviet statements regarding the re--
militarization of West Germany and its

 

 

consequences were not propaganda but
the considered and carefully thought-out view of the Soviet govern-
ment.

With Malenkov taking the lead, the Soviet
leaders repeated their familiar themes about the dangers of German
""militarism"" to France and Europe, the incompatibility of the Paris
agreements with the French-Soviet pact and with post-ratification
negotiations with Moscow, and the consequences which would follow
the entry into force of the Paris accords. When Joxe stated that
there was no doubt that the French assembly would ratify the agree-
ments, Malenkov expressed surprise and pointed to the recent re-
port of the assemblys Foreign Affairs Committee as evidence of
serious opposition in the French parliament.

In defending the Paris agreements, Joxe
blamed Stalin's postwar policies for creating a feeling of insecurity
and threat in Western Europe. Malenkov nodded his head in appar-
ent agreement, Bulganin and Mikoyan exchanged approving glances,
but Molotov, who was sullen and ""glacial' throughout the conversa-
tion, was visibly irritated. Ambassador Bohlen concurs in Joxe's
opinion that there is at least a difference of view within the Soviet
leadership as to what exactly should be done if and when the agree-
ments are ratified.

FAR EAST

3. Opposition subjecting President Rhee to unprecedented criticism:

 

 

 

President Rhee is being subjected to
unprecedented criticism by his opposi-
tion, according to Ambassador Briggs.

 

 

The ambassador believes the major
causes are Rhee's highhanded tactics in forcing through his con-
stitutional amendments and his prolonged dispute with the United
States over the aid program, which has undermined confidence in
his ability to deal with the United States. Opposition leaders say
Rhee is too old, misunderstands democracy, and has ""'smeared
and retarded"" parliamentary politics.

Briggs feels Rhee, to prevent further
deterioration of his position, will seek to prevent a serious rift
with Washington, and will institute strict controls over activities
of both his own and the opposition parties.

Comment: Rhee has begun a party
reorganization and is reported considering some cabinet changes
to prevent further defections from his party.

Only vigorous action by the police, which
Rhee still controls, can effectively stifle the opposition. That such
action is contemplated was suggested by Rhee's recent denunciation
of his opponents, including those persons advocating co-operation
with the United States on the aid program, as ""traitors.""

Chou En-lai says Peiping will not be ""intimidated' in airmen's

 

case:

 

 

 

Chou En-lai is reported to have told the
that Commu- 25X1
nist China would not be Mntimidated' in

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case of the 11 American airmen con-

victed as spies, but that if the airmen's behavior were good their

cases ""would be reviewed.' This account of the Chinese Commu-

nist position was given| | 25X1

 

 

 

 

- Chou mentioned to the ambassador the
""American"" action of sending to Formosa some 10,000 Chinese
prisoners of the Korean war who had refused repatriation, the
recent signing of a mutual security treaty between Nationalist
China and the United States, and the detention of some Chinese
students in the United States.

Chou alleged that the list of American
nationals held in Communist China which was provided by the
United States during the discussions at Geneva last summer did
not identify the 11 airmen as prisoners of war.

Comment: Chou's reported remarks,
like Peiping's propaganda, suggest that Chinese Communist pres-
tige is heavily committed in the airmen's case and that the pros-
pects are therefore poor for their early release. At the same
time, the door apparently remains open for an eventual settlement.

Should UN secretary general Hammerskjold
go to Peiping, the Chinese Communists could be expected to document

the ""spy' case in great detail and to present a list of allegedly
related grievances which have long been staples of Peiping's prop-
aganda.

There is no basis for Chou's implication
that the 11 airmen were regarded by the United States last summer
as civilians. The American list explicitly identified them as United

SOUTHE AST ASIA

Prominent nationalists express misgivings about Vietnamese

 

premier:

 

 

Phan Huy Quat told American officials
on 10 December he is now convinced
Premier Diem is merely finding pre-

 

 

texts to avoid appointing him defense
minister. After 15 discussions with Diem with regard to a cabi-
net appointment, Quat rejected the premier's latest proposal to
take him into the government if Quat could persuade the Cao Dai
and Hoa Hao sects to agree to it,

Quat criticized Diem's haste to elimi-
nate French influence and armed strength in Vietnam, stating
that he favored a more ""flexible' policy.

.Le Huu Tu, dean of the Vietnamese
Catholic bishops, told the embassy on 11 December that Diem's
appointment last July had aroused a ""wave of hope throughout
the country,""",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A001800400001-7,/meta-54400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1954

GENERAL

HICOG officials analyze possibilities of harassment of West Berlin:

 

 

American officials in Berlin believe that
a primary Soviet objective in the period
immediately following ratification of the
Paris agreements may be the isolation

 

 

of West Berlin irom East Germany, basically for internal security
reasons. A move toward this objective is not expected before rat-
ification, although it is possible that a few measures will be taken
to give substance to the threats, particularly against France, in
the Soviet antiratification campaign.

These officials warn that in the imme-
diate future a large number of reports--some true and some false--
about prospective harassing measures will probably be planted in
an attempt to influence the ratification debates. They are confi-
dent that a wide range of measures is being discussed in official
East German circles, but that firm evidence of official East Ger-
man decisions is lacking.

HICOG officials believe that reported
limitations on movements of persons within East Germany, while
unconfirmed, would be logical, in view of East German threats
to establish armed forces after ratification. They believe that
steps to interfere with the access of West German passengers and
freight to Berlin after ratification are less probable, and state
that as yet there are no reliable reports that such steps are
planned. .

FAR EAST

2. Japan frustrating attempts to tighten COCOM controls on copper:

 

 

 

The Japanese government has informed
the American embassy in Tokyo that it
has granted export licenses covering a
total of 7,300 tons of copper wire des-

 

 

tined for the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Poland. A Foreign Min-
istry official explained that Japan was ""late in engaging in this

GENERAL

Invitees initially wary of Asian-African conference:

 

 

 

[nitial reactions of several of the
principal invitees to the proposed
Asian-African conference show they
hre predominantly wary, according to
reports from American embassies.

 

 

Egypt and the other Arab states will
probably attend, although they had been led to believe Peiping
would not be invited. Jordan apparentlv fears the expense of
participation, however 25X

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ir:n, while preferring that no confer-
ence be held, will find it difficult to refuse if other Near East-
ern states accept. Cambodia is likely to be pressed by India
to accept. '

Thailand has already indicated hostility
to the Asian-African meecting, while Japan is seeking American
guidance. The Philippines is noncommittal, but there are indica-
tions that it will attend with reluctance. These reactions are not
definitive, but they indicate a feeling zmong a number of the in-
vitees that acceptance of the invitation, might be the lesser.of .
two evils.

Indians said to have dominated Cclombo powers conference:

 

 

 

Nehru and his principal adviser on
foreign affairs, Krishna Menon, domi-
nated the recent Colombo powers confer-
ence in Indonesia, since they were the

 

 

only delegates who seemed to know what they wanted, according
to the British embassy in Djakarta. Of the 17 points made in the

GENERAL

USSR attempting to use POW issue {0 undermine Adenauer:

 

 

 

The Soviet Union is reported to have of-
fered to repatriate 40,000 West German
prisoners of war if negotiations could be
undertaken, on the German side, by mem-

 

 

bers of the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Par-
ty. The offer was made through a West German businessman who
had raised the question with Soviet officials at East-West trade
talks last year. Chancellor Adenauer has been informed through
Free Democratic Party leaders.

The Soviet officials emphasized that
Moscow wanted Adenauer's opposition to receive credit for the
negotiations and flatly rejected talks with representatives of his
Christian Democratic Party. HICOG believes Moscow is hoping
to use the POW issue to delay ratification of the Paris agreements
as well as to sow dissension among the political parties by enhanc-
ing Socialist prestige at the expense of the Christian Democrats.

Comment: This Soviet attempt to under-
mine the Adenauer government is not likely to be successful. The
West Germans are likely to give much more credit to the individuals
involved in the negotiations than to the party. Adenauer would run
the risk of serious public disapproval, however, if he should attempt
to interfere with such an opportunity to repatriate imprisoned Ger-
mans.

Moscow for years has insisted it held only
13,500 POW's and has recently said a majority of these were returned
in 1953. The 40,000 figure--if accurate--may include many civilians.
German officials believe it is impossible to estimate the number still
held.

Soviet harassments in Austria expected to increase:

 

 

The American embassy in Vienna expects
increasing Soviet harassment of the Austrians.
It believes, however, that the USSR is un-
likely to take actual moves toward partition,

even immediately after ratification of the Paris accords, because
the resulting international crisis would conflict with over-all
Soviet policy. The Soviet Union appears to be laying the ground-
work for dramatic moves which would give the impression of an
intention to partition Austria if the accords are ratified.

To this end, Soviet authorities have set up
facilities for check points around Vienna, and may reimpose the
zonal border controls and check points abandoned in June 1953, even
to the extent of interfering with freight traffic. They may also in-
crease their interference with the Austrian police.

The embassy expects the Soviet propaganda
campaign to reach a new pitch of intensity in coming weeks, further
emphasizing the Soviet threat first made at the Allied Council meet-
ing on 21 December concerning the ""danger to the integrity of the
Austrian state"" from American actions in western Austria. Commu-
nist propaganda on the threat to Austrian unity has been highlighted
by a Communist-front call for a congress in Vienna on 13 March
dedicated to Austrian ""unity and independence.""

FAR EAST

 

 

 

 

Comment: Peiping could undertake an
amphibious operation against the Matsus and Quemoys at any time.
Moreover, the Chinese Communists are apparently readying air
bases in Fukien Province which will give them a large complex
of fields from which they could mount air attacks on the Matsus
and Quemoys as they did on the Tachens.

As Peiping is probably in doubt about
Amencan intentions regarding the defense of the offshore islands,
the Chinese Communists seem most likely first to undertake prob-
ing operations against the Matsus and Quemoys with limited artil-
lery, naval and air attacks.

SOUTHE AST ASIA

French plan joint corporations with Viet Minh:

 

 

 

France is planning to turn over to the
Viet Minh a controlling interest in French
industrial installations in the Haiphong
perimeter after the Communists take

 

 

over thal city in May, according to the director of economic af-
fairs for the French Foreign Ministry. He told American officials
in Paris on 7 February that under arrangements now being con-
sidered, France will retain possibly a 40-percent interest which
will be divided between the present owners and a French govern-
ment agency. No formal agreement has yet been reached with the

Viet Minh, but Jean Sainteny, French delegate general to North
Vietnam, has been authorized to negotiate.

The French official added that Paris be-
lieves the maintenance of French interests could have a '""""moderat-
ing'"" effect on ""extremist elements' in North Vietnham. The Amer-
ican embassy in Paris believes that Viet Minh officials have al-
ready been consulted on the plan.

Comment: The Viet Minh would profit
from the techmcal know-how and capital gained through such an
arrangement, but could be expected to support it only as long as
they find it advantageous.

While much of the impetus for the Sainteny
mission stemmed from Mendes-France's desire to experiment in
""coexistence,"" it is unlikely that any new French premier will cur-
tail Sainteny's activities immediately. The proposed plan will
probably be explained on the grounds that no alternative gives hope
of salvaging anything when the Communists take over.

dominant position in Cambodian political life, Postponing his
nreturn to the people,'"" Sihanouk took complete charge of a mili-
tary graduation ceremony on 5 March at which the new king was
present, and was evidently vastly pleased with himself in his new
role, according to Ambassador McClintock.

He informed the American ambassador
that ""he had arranged"" with the palace and the government for
negotiations on American aid to be brought to a speedy conclusion.
To this end, he had appointed his mother his ""plenipotentiary.""
McClintock believes Sihanouk will continue to be king in everything
except name, acting through a sort of ""shogunate,""' and his spokes-
men will be his three privy councilors.

In the event Sihanouk tires of his present
role, he may arrange to have his throne restored to him. There
are precedents for such action in Cambodian history, and the
machinery exists for organizing a ""spontaneous demand' for Sihanouk's
return. Such a restoration would, moreover, have the strong sup-
port of the present king and queen, who have been conspicuously ill
at ease in their new roles.

Arrests of Indonesian opposition members may indicate future

 

government election tactics:

 

 

A number of opposition Masjumi party
leaders were arrested in late February,
the day before a town election in West
Java, according to the Indonesian press.

 

 

 

|the arrests were

 

25X1C

responsible for the National Party's winning the election by a slim
plurality, since the detainees were unable to vote and their fami-
lies were afraid to. Ostensibly the arrests were in connection
with the activities of armed bands in the area, and the Masjumi
fears they may be an indication of future National Party tactics

to upset the Masjumi organization.

The election returns in the town showed
the Communists a strong third party.

Comment: Both the National Party, which
heads the cabinet, and the Communist Party, which supports it, fear
a Masjumi victory in Indonesia's forthcoming first general elections
because of the Masjumi's identification with Mohammedanism, the
nation's predominant religion. As one of their campaign tactics,
these two parties have tried to identify the Masjumi with the illegal
Darul Islam, a fanatical Moslem organization and Indonesia's prin-
cipal dissident group. The February arrests apparently were made
largely on these grounds.

The Communists have campaigned more
actively than any other party, and are reported gaining strength at
the expense of both the National Party and the Masjumi.

FAR EAST

Madame Rhee seen gaining importance as President Rhee's
health fails:

 

 

 

Ambassador Briggs, following farewell
talks with South Korean cabinet ministers,
reports that President Rhee's health is
slowly but definitely failing. He states that

 

 

. Madame Rhee now controls the papers the president sees and, to a

considerable extent, whom he sees.

 

' Comment: 25X1
members of Rhee's secretariat have assumed greater authority in
dealing with Korean officials on the ministerial level since Rhee
underwent surgery in January.

 

 

 

In the event of Rhee's increasing incapac-
itation, it may be expected that Madame Rhee and the secretariaf,
in isolating the president, will strive to obscure the extent of his in-
capacity and to maintain the position of the present governing group.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

3. Binh Xuyen reportedly in contact with Viet Minh:

 

 

 

 

 

Comment: The Binh Xuyen was allied
with the Viet Minh after World War II. It later rallied to the Bao
Dai government, from which it received economic concessions.
General Ely recently expressed concern that the Binh Xuyen might
again sell out to the Viet Minh.

The Viet Minh on 8 April broadcast from

Hanoi an appeal by an alleged ex-Binh Xuyen commander to his com-
rades in the south, urging them to overthrow the Diem government.

GENERAL

1. USSR appears ready to end London disarmament talks:

 

Soviet ambassador Malik made it clear
at the UN disarmament subcommittee
talks in London on 5 May that the USSR
is not willing to compromise on any
point and will accept no disarmament schedule but its own. He
insisted that the Western position is unacceptable because it
provides for the prohibition of nuclear weapons too late in the
program and it gives the control organ ""improper powers"" to
interfere in the domestic affairs of the signatory powers.

 

 

 

Soviet officials at London have suggested
informally to Western officials on three occasions in the last two
weeks the possibility of recessing the talks, with Malik on the
latest occasion making it clear that the only problem was that no
power wanted to bear the blame for a break-off.

Comment: Moscow apparently considers
that it is gaining no substantial propaganda benefit from the London
talks. Moscow probably expects to shift the disarmament question
to the level of a foreign ministers' conference, as indicated in
Soviet propaganda and implied by a remark of Mikoyan during the
Moscow talks with Austrian leaders. | | 25X1

 

 

FAR EAST

2. Nehru has twice requested Peiping to release American airmen:

 

 

Indian prime minister Nehru told Ambas-
sador Cooper on 5 May that he had written
to Chou En-lai several weeks before the
Bandung conference requesting the release

 

 

~0T American airmen 1mprisoned in China. Nehru again raised the
question when he and Chou met in Rangoon enroute to Bandung, and
Chou said Peiping would consider the matter further on his return.

Nehru also extracted from Chou an
admission that he did not believe the United States government
sabotaged the Indian airliner which crashed on the way to Bandung
on 11 April. Chou said he thought the Chinese Nationalists were
guilty,

Comment: This is the first indication
that Nehru has actively urged the release of the airmen in recent
months. India took considerable pains to demonstrate its neu-
trality in arranging for the visit of UN secretary general Hammar-
skjold to Peiping in this connection last January, and has been re-
ported unwilling, because Hammarskjold has failed thus far to
achieve the release of the airmen, to make further approaches to
China.

Nehru's remarks suggest that he is will-
ing to press China on various matters more strongly than is gen-
erally believed. ",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A002000260001-0,/meta-67000,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1955

Comment: A French withdrawal prior
to the planned all-Vietnam elections of 1956 would constitute
a disavowal of France's responsibilities under the Geneva ac-
cords and thus open the way for Communist charges that France
had capitulated to the American policy of ""turning South Vietnam
into a base for military aggression.,' The French have consist-
ently urged a rigorous application of the Geneva accords.

The French government is determined
to avoid the onus for any further disaster in Indochina, and

-Faure's relatively strong parliamentary situation may encourage

him not to temporize.. Mendes-France's recent success in win-
ning control of the party machinery of the premier's Radical
Socialist Party will incite Faure to prove himself a man of """"move-
ment,""",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A002000270001-9,/meta-66600,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1955

GENERAL

1. USSR may offer Yugoslavia ""atomic energy"" and seek jomt state-
ment on German neutrality and disarmament:

 

25X1 o The USSR will offer Yugoslavia ""atomic
energy"" for peaceful purposes during the
Belgrade conference and will endeavor to
obtain Yugoslav approval in principle for
neutral Germany and jor the latest Soviet disarmament proposals.

 

 

 

25X1

 

 

Comment: In addition to the announced
Soviet intention of building atomic reactors in countries of the
Sino-Soviet bloe, the USSR has hinted willingness to lend similar
assistance to non-Orbit countries. Such an offer would appeal to
the Yugoslavs, who, claiming that atomic energy will usher in the
age of Socialism, strongly subscribe to the principle of interna-
tional co-operation on atomic matters as an aid to their own pro-
gram.

Belgrade, while never fully explicit on
the subject, has in recent months strongly favored a reunified, un-
committed Germany. Likewise, it has reacted favorably to the
latest Soviet moves on disarmament. The Soviet and Yugoslav
leaders can probably find enough common ground on both subjects
to issue statements of agreement on basic principles.

(Concurred in by OSI)

2. USSR apparently made large purchases of copper in Western
Europe recently:

 

 

25X1 T. T. Ivanov, a leading official of a

Soviet foreign trade agency, told[ | 25X1
|that the 25X1
USSR no longer had any interest in buy-

ing copper becausée oI purchases ''this past week' in Europe. 25X1

Comment: This information suggests
that Soviet trade officials, fearing a tightening of Western export
controls, have contracted for large quantities of copper very re-
cently. The Soviet Union has taken advantage of the relaxation
in controls last August to make substantial purchases of copper
wire in Western Europe. (Concurred in by ORR)

FAR EAST
Japan sets policy for talks with USSR:

 

 

The Japanese government has decided
to seek the settlement of specific prob-
lems between Japan and the USSR in the
forthcoming talks before consenting to

 

 

establish diplomatic relations. Foreign Ministry adviser Tani,
however, told Ambassador Allison on 25 May that domestic polit-
ical considerations might make it impossible strictly to follow

this policy.

Tani said that Tokyo believes the forth-
coming Japan-Soviet negotiations will be affected by the proposed
four-power meeting ""at the summit,"" and will defer any final ac-
tion pending the results of the latter conference. He said the
Japanese would resist Soviet attempts to introduce Communist
China into the discussions, and would co-ordinate with the United
States any response to Soviet proposals for Japanese neutrality.

Comment: Moscow may seek a quick
agreement to resume diplomatic relations with Japan, leaving the
more troublesome issues for future deliberation,

to the elected assembly.

Comment The Diem government believes that it

will be subjected to increased inter-
national pressure to enter into consultations with the Viet
Minh as a result of the foreign ministers' conference in
October. It hopes that this pressure can be met by these
moves. Preliminary planning for an elected assembly be-
gan last spring; it is probable that Diem will delay actual
elections until he feels sBure they will not threaten his con-
trol of the government,

A Foreign Ministry spokesman in
Saigon has indicated that the referendum on Bao Dai will
be held on 23 October.

2. SOVIET HARVEST MAY BE HIGHEST SINCE WAR

 

25X1A
25X1A

 

 

 

 

Total Soviet grain production this year
probably exceeds the postwar high set
in 1952, Final figures for other im-
portant crops, such as sugar beets,

 

 

potatoes and cotton, are expected to show improvement
over last year.

There was a 2b-percent expansion of
total wheat acreage over 1954. The ""new lands' area,
where most of this expansion occurred, was hard hit by
drought. The total harvest there, however, is expected
to be larger than that of last year. There was good weather
in the important wheat areas of the Ukraine and North
Caucasus.

A good wheat crop this year will en-
able the USSR to rebuild wheat reserves depleted during
the last two years or undertake some expansion of wheat
exports.

Success of the corn program, Khrush-
chev's key to the fodder supply this year and in the future,
cannot yet be gauged. (Prepared by ORR)

3. ESTABLISHMENT OF SOVIET-LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS MAY BE IMMINENT

l

25X1 25X1A the establishment of diplo-
matic relations between Libya and

the Soviet Union may be imminent. An announcement
to this effect may be made on 25 September.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Comment Soviet approaches to Libya for the
) establishment of diplomatic relations

were reported early this month. If Libya has in fact
agreed to open diplomatic relations, the USSR has prob-
ably agreed to support Libya's candidacy for UN mem-
bership. This support, however, would probably be
limited to the inclusion of Libya in a '""package deal"" in-
cluding several of the Soviet Satellites] |

USSR OFFERS MUNITIONS TO SYRIA

25X1A

 

 

The Soviet minister in Damascus
offered on 27 September to provide
arms to Syria. The offer was made
to Syrian prime minister Ghazzi on

 

 

the basis of a two- or three-year credit to be paid for by

Syrian cotton and other export commodities. President

Quwatli said that the Syrian government is taking the

offer under consideration, | | 25X1

 

 

Ghazzi gave evasive replies to in-
quiries by Ambassador Moose on 29 September. Ques-
tions by the British chargé were also evasively answered
by the minister of national economy. Moose believes the
prime minister's failure to deny the offer supports other
evidence that arms discussions have taken place between
Syria and the USSR.

Comment Syrian arms are generally antiquated

1

and heterogeneous; armored vehicles
in particular are in short supply. Chief of Staff Shuqayr
probably would accept arms from any source if he be-
lieved they would help him stay in power and if he could
get government approval.

 

25X1

 

 

 

While Soviet munitions offers them-
selves are important in terms of their immediate effect
in the Middle East, the types of long-term barter agree-
ments involved are even more significant. Once they
establish a steady market in the Soviet bloc for exports
important to their economies, such Middle Eastern coun-
tries as Egypt and Syria will be under pressure to hold
on to this market. | |

4, RETURN OF BEN YOUSSEF TO MOROCCAN THRONE
EXPECTED BY 18 NOVEMBER

25X1A

 

A French Foreign Ministry spokesman
has told American embassy officials
that Mohamed ben Youssef will prob-
ably be restored to the Moroccan
throne before 18 November, the anniversary of his ac-
cession to the throne in 1927.

 

 

 

The official assumed that Paris would
simultaneously accept the resignation Resident General
Boyer de Latour has tendered several times recently.
Leon Marchal, secretary general of the Council of Eu-
rope, who resigned from the Foreign Ministry in 1953
in protest against Ben Youssef's removal, and General
Marie Bethouart, who currently represents the French
of Morocco in the French Council of the Republic, were
mentioned as possible successors.

Comment Pressure is being built up by the na-
tionalists to keep Ben Youssef from
making concessions before returning tc Morocco, while
Paris is believed to be trying to reach a favorable agree-
ment with the former sultan before he returns. Current
- activities of the Moroccan nationalists in their demands
for independence raise doubts that Ben Youssef's return
will quiet the country.

THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION

25X1A (Information as of 1700 4 November)

 

 

 

Military action, aside from a minor

skirmish in the southern part of the Gaza area on the

morning of 4 November and sporadic fighting in the El

Auja area, appears to have ceased, | | 2EX1A

 

The Israeli Foreign Ministry announced
on 3 November: ""The Israeli Defense Force operation was
aimed at removing the Egyptian forces from Israeli area.""
This, according to Israeli spokesmen, has been accomplished.

 

25X1

 

 

 

According to a UN observer, about 750
Israeli troops participated in the attack. This official also
reported that on the evening of 3 November UN observers
were again given freedom of movement on the Israeli side
but not on the Egyptian side. Israeli statements and atti-
tudes suggest that they are ready to consider this particular 25X1A
incident closed. |

GOVERNMENT ISSUE il 25X1A

25X1A

 

 

 

 

 

. 25X1A A government crisis has developed in
Indonesia following an incident on 14
December when a ceremony to install

a new deputy air chief of staff was

broken up by a-show of arms by disaffected air force person-
nel. The incident was apparently planned by Air Chief of
Staff Suryadarma, who seems to have had the backing of
President Sukarno. Suryadarma has reportedly eluded
house arrest and taken refuge at the president's palace.

 

 

 

Sukarno and leftist elements may have
hoped to bring down the government by this maneuver so
that they could exercise a decisive influence over the gov-
ernment reorganization that is to take place during the next
few months.

The cabinet, after a long meeting late
on 15 December, was reported determined to press for the
arrest of Suryadarma and Jwa, the pro-Communist former
defense minister. who apparently backed Suryadarma. The
prime minister, however, apparently had difficulty getting
support for this decision from the representatives of small
parties in his coalition cabinet who are reluctant to come into
open conflict with Sukarno. Even the army, which is support-
ing the prime minister, does not relish a contest with the
president. ",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A002300290001-4,/meta-50600,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1955

1. RANGOON CONSIDERING SOVIET OFFERS TO UNDERWRITE 25X1A
BURMA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

 

 

 

 

25X1A A high Burmese planning official told the

American embassy in Rangoon on 18 De-
cember that his government is seriously
considering a Soviet offer to provide all
the ass1stance necessary to carry out Burma's economic de-
velopment program. He stated that even U Kyaw Nyein, the
most outspokenly anti-Communist member of the Burmese
cabinet, had reached the conclusion that Burma had no alter-
native but to accept this Soviet aid. The Burmese official
stated that he was preparing comprehensive project requests
to be submitted to the Russians.

 

 

 

Comment Any sweeping Soviet offer which appears
to promise quick results would appeal to
the Burmese, whose economic planning has always been
grandiose. Burma is attempting by 1960 to raise its gross
national product by one third over the prewar level.

The Burmese are confident that their
ability to maintain control of Burma's destiny will not be se-
riously impaired by exclusive Soviet participation in their
development plans. So far they have exhibited little suspicion
that strings might be attached to Soviet aid offers. They have
frequently complained of the red tape and restrictions involved
in Western offers.

25X1A

 

 

Syrian chief of staff Shugayr will be
removed shortly, | 25X1

 

 

 

 

Dissatisfaction within the officer ranks

 

25X1

 

is making his position untenable and there is danger that he
may be assassinated.

The embassy comments that Shuqayr's
future would appear to depend on whether:and how strongly
conservative elements in Syria rally to his support. It feels
that his dismissal would remove the last real obstacle to the
assumption of full control over the army by anti-Western ele-
ments and might lead to leftist control over the government.

Comment S'huqayr has previously exhibited consid-

erable political agility and has long maneu-
vered  successfully between the. various conflicting elements
struggling for control in Syria. | | 25X1

Qconservative elements in Syria, with Iraqi sup-
port, may be preparing for a showdown.

Shugayr has been under increasing pres-
sure to obtain arms from the Soviet bloc and to avoid any
agreement with the West. Syrian humiliation over the Israeli
raid at Tiberias is apparently being used against Shugayr as

a means of obtaining either his removal or his compliance
with leftist demands.

3.- NEW CRISIS THREATENS IN JORDAN

 

The 4 January supreme court decision
that King Hussain's 19 December disso-
lution of the Jordan parliament was ille-
gal has infuriated Jordanian elements
25X1A hostile to the Baghdad pact, which had
hoped to dominate a newly elected par-
liament. The consulate general in
Jerusalem expects renewed rioting.

 

 

The governmental problem remains un-
resolved, with rumors that the caretaker cabinet may resign.
The authority and prestige of the throne have declined and

the British position has been severely damaged. Egypt's
prestige has risen sharply and it is unlikely that any Jordanian
decisions in the near future involving Israel or Middle East
problems will be taken without the approval of Cairo.

2. SERIOUS DISORDERS IN SINGAPORE BELIEVED LIKELY

 

 

Serious disturbances are anticipated

in Singapore if the talks in London
scheduled to begin on 23 April break
down. A breakdown may occur, since
Singapore's Chief Minister Marshall is
prepared to make demands for complete
independence, which the British govern-
ment does not intend to meet. The crit-

 

 

1cal 1ssue 1s responsibility for internal security. Should
Marshall reject compromise proposals and widespread dis-
order subsequently develop, the British may be forced to
resume direct control of the colony.

In anticipation of difficulty, troops from
Malaya have been sent to Singapore and to adjacent main-
land areas. 25X1

25X1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Large-scale demonstrations, with Com-
munist participation, are expected in any event on 1 May,
and on 13 May, the anniversary of student-labor riots last
year. Marshalls delegation includes representatives of the
Communist-influenced People's Action Party. This party
undoubtedly had a voice in Marshall's eleventh-hour demands,
which go beyond those made by the separately administered

 

 

 

 

- Federation of Malaya last February. 25X1

MOROCCAN FINANCE MINISTER ESTIMATES ANTICIPATED
INCOME FROM US BASES

 

25X1A

 

Moroccan minister of finance Benjelloun
recently informed a member of the

French National Assembly's Foreign
Affairs Committee he considered an annual

 

 

25X1A

rental of 1oU billion francs (about $430,000,000) a reasonable
rental, considering the indispensability of the bases to United
States security. . Benjelloun reportedly indicated that he is
planning to meet many of Morocco's obligations, particularly
in the field of defense, with revenues from the rental of base
sites to the United States.

Comment Benjelloun is a member of the minority

party participating in the present care-

taker Moroccan governmgnt and does not necessarily repre-

sent the views of the sultan or the majority Istiqlal party.
Nevertheless his suggestion is in line with other reports

that the new Moroccan government will be bargaining sharply
on the bases.

French officials have thought that Morocco
would seek a rental large enough to cover its expected annual
fiscal deficit--estimated by the French at $200,000,000.

4. JAPANESE TREND TOWARD RECOGNITION OF PEIPING

GAINING STRENGTH

 

 

The prospect of early restoration of
normal relations between Japan and
the USSR is accelerating the strong
trend in Japan toward the recognition

 

 

of Communist China. Japanese foreign minister Shigemitsu
emphasized this view to Ambassador Allison on 23 May by
stating that he believed his government would do little to
reverse this trend. '

A majority of Japanese, on the political
right as well as the left, have long held that Japan must
ultimately establish diplomatic relations with Communist
China, and Tokyo's primary concern has been only the tim-
ing of moves in that direction. Shigemitsu, in noting the
recent Egyptian recognition of Communist China, the presi-
dent of Pakistan's suggestion that the United States recognize
Peiping, and the prospective establishment of a French trade
mission, apparently was expressing official anxiety that
further delay might isolate Japan from its most important
Asian neighbor.

THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION
(Information as of 1700, 25 May)

The Soviet military attaché in Syria
stated in a conversation with the American army attaché
that while the T-34 medium tank was suitable for use in
Syria, he was opposed to Syria receiving JS-3 heavy tanks
and had so recommended. He added that the Syrians would
be better off fighting on camels than in tanks. The Soviet
assistant military attaché also declared that even the new
military equipment which Syria was receiving would dete-
riorate rapidly because of Syria's improper maintenance
of tanks and vehicles.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

|
]Egyptia.n armored forces now

 

include two companies of JS-3 heavy tanks, each with 17

tanks mounting 122-mm guns; three companies of SU-100

assault guns, each with 17 100-mm self-propelled guns; a

regiment of T-34 medium tanks organized into three

companies of 17 tanks each, mounting 85-mm guns; a

similar regiment in which each company is reported

equipped with 17 T-34s mounting 100-mm guns; and a

regiment of Centurions organized into two companies wi

17 tanks each. Existence of a T-34 with a 100-mm gun

has not been confirmed; however, the new Soviet medium

tank, the T-54, mounting a 100-mm gun, has been issued

in large quantities to Soviet forces in Germany. No T-54

has previously been reported in connection with the Soviet

bloc arms shipments to Egypt. It is not known whether 25X1A
the above units are part of Egypt's newly formed tank

2. NASR REPORTED STILL DETERMINED TO OUST
AMERICAN AID MISSION

 

25X1A

25X1A Egyptian president Nasr is still
determined to request the with-
drawal of the United States ICA
mission in Egypt, 25X1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25X1

 

Comment Nasr was previously reported to
have considered announcing the end
of American aid to Egypt when he made his 26 July speech.
Since that date, Egyptian statements have concentrated
their fire on Britain and France, the powers most imme-
diately concerned with the Suez Canal Company seizure.
Nasr may well be holding a denunciation of American aid
in reserve as a response to any American action in sup-
port of the British and French positions on Suez. 25X1

3. BOHLEN COMMENTS ON SOVIET INTENTIONS IN
SUEZ DISPUTE

25X1A

 

Ambassador Bohlen expects the USSR
to move cautiously if Western response
to nationalization of the Suez Canal is
firm and effective, but he believes the
7~ USSR will fully exploit the breach between Egypt and the
West if it sees no direct risk to itself. Bohlen expects that
if the question is raised in the UN Security Council, the USSR
would almost certainly veto any consideration of the issue.

 

 

Comment Copious commentaries in the Soviet press
indicate the USSR's approval of Nasr's
move but do not hint at any specific course of action. Recent
Soviet policy has indicated that the USSR wishes to avoid an
outbreak of hostilities in the Near East. The USSR is expected
to give Nasr both economic and political support in his resist-
ance to Western courses of action.

2. ANTI-COMMUNIST DEMONSTRATIONS SEEN POSSIBLE

IN HUNGARY AND POLAND

Comment on:

 

 

Communist and anti-Russian demon-
strations may occur in Hungary and
Poland during the next few days.

The Hungarian party, apparently in
symbolic rejection of Soviet domina-
tion, has announced a ceremonial

 

 

funeral procession in Budapest on 6
October bearing the remains of Laszlo Rajk, the former
Titoist and ''national deviationist'"" now hailed as an """"out-

~ standing leader of Hungarian labor,' and three Commu-

nists executed with Rajk. Before the Communist takeover,
6 October was traditionally celebrated as a day of mourn-
ing for 13 Hungarian generals executed by the Austrians

in 1849 as a direct result of Russian intervention in
Hungary's struggle for liberation.

The public, which has not been involved
so far in the party's disputes, may use the occasion to
demonstrate its dislike for the Communists and the Russians.

In Poland, tension reportedly is high in
Poznan as the city awaits the 8 October verdict in the trial
of three youths accused of murdering a secret police cor-
poral. Western newsmen in Poznan claim that many groups,
and particularly young workers, feel they must indicate
their solidarity with the accused by demonstrating when the
verdicts are announced. The government is prepared, with
reinforced security forces in Poznan, to quell any disturb-
ances quickly. | |

3. ANTIGOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS SPREADING

IN IRAQ

 

 

Antigovernment and pro-Nasr demon-
strations in Baghdad, which were
Eouched off by the Anglo-French inter-
wention in Egypt, have now spread to
other sections of Iraq. The govern-
ment has reinforced military units
around the city and moved troops south
to support local police. Baghdad radio
announced on 30 November that martial
law had been proclaimed in four northern
provinces.

 

 

25X1

A change of prime ministers reportedly

is under discussion in Baghdad. Since no former prime
minister appears willing to assume the liabilities of Nuri's
pro-British policies, the palace may try to ride out the
storm with Nuri Said. Crown Prince Abdul Illah told Am-
pbassador Gallman on 96 November that even if Nuri were
replaced, there would be no change in foreign policy. He
said membership in the Baghdad pact should be maintained
as well as close relations with the West.

The Iraqi government has the police

power available to control antigovernment demonstrations.
The American army attaché reports that the Iragi air force
has been """"buzzing"" Baghdad with jet planes for several days,
probably to intimidate the populace against further demonstra-

 

tions.

ALGIERS REPORTED LIKELY

25X1A

 

The American consulate general in
Algiers has been informed by reliable
sources that US installations in that
city would again be a target for attacks
during January. The local French ad-
ministration has indicated an awareness of such reports
and has offered police protection,

 

 

 

Comment Settler frustration and exasperation over
France's failure to suppress rebel terror-

ism has recently taken an increasingly anti-American orien-
tation. On 29 December, European extremists, who subse-
quently attacked Moslems at random throughout Algiers,
demonstrated angrily for about an hour in front of the con-
sulate general. The premises were not entered, but the
consular seal and brass plaque were torn down and defaced
while the police, who were present, remained largely inac-
tive.

C D 2. INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT PLANNING CONCESSIONS
TO PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS

 

The Indonesian government is making a be-
25X1A lated effort to eliminate the chief sources
of Sumatran disaffection. As a prelude to
granting greater autonomy, the Home Affairs
minister has announced that legislation is
being drafted to set up six Sumatran prov-
inces to replace the present three. A law
has already been passed by parliament, and
is awaiting Sukarno's signature, providing
= that provincial governors be locally elected rather than gov-
ernment-appointed as they are now, Djakarta has also indi-
cated a willingness to make additional funds available to out-
lying provinces. It is likely that other provinces will seek to
take advantage of the central government's conciliatory atti-
tude.

 

 

 

The government is also continuing its ef-
forts to avoid bloodshed. The government radio in Medan,
North Sumatra, has announced the suspension of all licenses
permitting civilians to carry arms in the Siantar area. The
order presumably is an effort to disarm Communists who had
been armed by the local regimental commander. It is highly
unlikely, however, that the government can reclaim these arms,

1. EGYPT PLANS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IF
CANAL MEMORANDUM IS REJECTED

25X1A

 

 

 

 

Ali Sabri, Nasr's chief political ad-
25X1A viser, stated on 27 March that if
Egypt's memorandum on the Suez
Canal meets an unfavorable response
from a majority of the nations who received it, the only
alternative will be to call an international conference of
interested nations. These nations presumably would be
chosen and invited by Egypt. Sabri said the Egyptian gov-
ernment anticipated an unfavorable reaction from Britain,
and especially from France, but that it had no intention

of calling a conference merely to satisfy one or two '""""mal-
contents.""

 

 

 

Sabri said the memorandum as it
stands is the product of Nasr's talks with UN Secretary
General Hammarskjold and also reflects some Indian ideas.
The Egyptians expect comments from the recipients--the
United States, the USSR, India, Yugoslavia, Syria, Jordan
and Saudi Arabia--and are willing to modify the memorandum
to meet ""reasonable' comments """"compatible with Egyptian
sovereignty.""

In emphasizing Egypt's intention to keep
politics out of the canal and to run it as a business, Sabri
stated that Israeli ships would be the exception since Israeli
passage of the canal would be tantamount to political suicide
for the Nasr regime. He said any decision by the Interna-
tional Court of Justice favoring Israeli transit of the canal
would simply be rejected. 25X1

4. MAKARIOS' RELEASE POSSIBLE PRELUDE TO NEW

CYPRUS NEGOTIATIONS

 

 

London's release of Archbishop Makarios
from exile in the Seychelles, announced

on 28 March, will probably result in new
negotiations with him over Cyprus' future.
A Colonial Office official said on 27 March,
however, that the British are not disposed
to start new negotiations immediately,

 

 

partly because of Turkish opposition, and
will not allow Makarios to return to Cyprus. | 25X6

 

 

25X6

 

 

 

 

 

While Britain has published a statement
from Makarios which includes a demand for direct conversa-
tions between the British government and the Cypriots, Colo-
nial Secretary Lennox-Boyd prefers to seek the ""good offices""
of NATO first, but indicated talks with Makarios and other
Cypriots would be considered later. Many officials believe
Makarios is the only leader capable of obtaining any Cypriot
co-operation on the Radcliffe constitution. Pressure for early
talks with Makarios would be increased if EOKA leader Grivas

 

 

accepts the safe-conduct to leave Cyprus offered by London on
28 March. Any negotiations would presumably be based on the
Radcliffe constitutional proposals for limited self-government.

If Makarios goes to Athens, however, which
he is now free to do, the Greek government will be seriously
embarrassed and the attendant propaganda will retard progress
toward any solution.

7. HUNGARY RETURNING TO STALINISM

 

 

Hungarian premier Kadar's speech in
Moscow on 27 March indicates an un-
abashed return to Stalinism and offi-

cial adulation of the USSR in Hungary.
Kadar said that some policies in Hun-

 

 

gary during the Stalin-Rakosi era--particularly the regime's
treatment of the bourgeoisie--were too lenient, and that Ra-
kosi's mistakes were overshadowed by his ""'lasting achieve-
-ments.""

Kadar and Soviet premier Bulganin
raised the possibility of a Stalinist-type show trial by their
vigorous denunciations of Imre Nagy for treason to state
and party. They also charged Yugoslavia with involvement
in the Hungarian revolution. Bulganin claimed to have evi-
dence that Nagy was plotting against the state long before
October 1956. Bulganin's charge that Yugoslav leaders gave
Nagy ""practical support"" above and beyond propaganda and
moral aid is the first such Soviet attack, and will probably

 

provoke a violent Yugoslav response.

USSR PROPOSES $200,000,000 BARTER ARRANGEMENT
TO SPAIN

 

 

The Spanish cabinet has under considera-
tion a Soviet proposal for a $200,000,000
barter arrangement, according to the

Spanish Foreign Ministry. The proposal

 

 

provides for the exchange of Spanish goods for Soviet tractors
and machinery. -

The USSR has made numerous other over-
tures in recent months for a restoration of diplomatic and
trade relations with Spain. In view of Spain's current econom-
ic difficulties, the Soviet offer may prove hard to resist. The
Spanish may regard it as an excellent lever to speed up US ac-
tion on Madrid's request for $25,000,000 to $30,000,000 worth
of industrial raw materials and machinery from the United
States. It is unlikely, however, that the Spanish government
would agree to any formal diplomatic or economic relation-
ship which does not satisfy Spain's claims to the $500,000,000
in gold which the Spanish Republican government sent to Mos-
cow during the Civil War.

9. SERIOUS TROUBLE FORECAST FOR FRANCO REGIME

 

 

Retiring Spanish foreign minister
Martin Artajo told American chargé
Byington on 26 March that he felt
there was ""'trouble in store' for the

 

 

government unless it could achieve a greater degree of
liberalization and get closer to the people.

Byington believes that the critical
economic situation may worsen. He points out, however,
that Martin Artajo's decision to remain in Madrid rather
than accept an ambassadorial post abroad indicates that
he does not expect any major political upheaval.

Comment The regime's failure to stem the mount-

ing inflationary threat has aroused in-
creasing concern throughout the country. There is growing
worker unrest over the rising cost of living and continued
student hostility to restrictions on freedom of thought and ex-
pression. The Church has also shown signs of wishing to dis-
sociate itself from a government that is becoming increasingly
unpopular, and military leaders fear the possible results of
Franco's refusal to arrange for an orderly succession of pow-
ers.

ANNEX

 

Watch Report 347, 28 March
of the
Intelligence Advisory Committee

Conclusions on Indications of Hostilities

On the basis of findings by its Watch Committee, the
Intelligence Advisory Committee concludes that:

A. No Sino-Soviet bloc country intends to initiate hostilities
against the continental US or its possessions in the imme-
diate future.

B. No Sino-Soviet bloc country intends to initiate hostilities
against US forces abroad, US allies or areas peripheral
to the Orbit in the immediate future.

C. A deliberate initiation of hostilities against Israel by the
Arab states is improbable in the immediate future. Israel,
though apparently still relying on diplomatic measures,
may at any time renew hostilities if faced with one or more
provocations, such as an introduction of substantial Egyp-
tian military forces into the Gaza strip, a renewal of ex-
tensive fedayeen raids, or an attempted denial of passage
for Israeli shipping through the Straits of Tiran. Other
unsettled issues and tensions in the Middle East, espe-
cially in Syria and Jordan, also constitute possibilities
for violence.

2., BOMBARDMENT OF QUEMOY ISLANDS BY

CHINESE COMMUNISTS

 

 

Chinese Communist artillery on 10 May
fired more than 600 rounds on the Quemoy
group--the heaviest shelling of these is-
lands so far this year. The Chinese Na-
tionalist news agency reports that the
Nationalist garrisons on the islands have
been alerted for a possible invasion.

 

 

The number of rounds fired on 10 May is
far from a record total. Some 6,000 rounds were fired on the
islands on 3 September 1954, nearly 3,000 rounds on 20 Jan-
uary 1956, and over 1,000 rounds on 28 April 1956. Most of
the artillery exchanges in the past year were initiated by the
Nationalists. No report is yet available to indicate which side
initiated the latest shelling.

The most favorable period for amphibious
operations is now at hand, but the Chinese Communists would
probably bring up more than the 89,000 troops believed to be
in the Amoy area before launching a full-scale attack against
the Quemoys, which are garrisoned by 84,000 Chinese Nation-
alists, However, Communist strength in the area is adequate
to assault one of the smaller islands in the Quemoys, such as
Erhtan or Tatan.

The Chinese Communist air force continues
to maintain a generally defensive posture in the Taiwan Strait
area. Prior to an amphibious assault on the Quemoys, the
Communists would probably bring their bombers and fighters
within closer range of the islands. Newly constructed airfields
opposite the offshore islands are serviceable but still unoccu-
pied.

The shelling of the Quemoys coincides with
sharp Communist propaganda reaction to the announcement that

1. ZORIN'S SPEECH AT THE LONDON TALKS

25X1 The United States delegate to the London

disarmament talks regards Soviet dele-
gate Zorin's 90-minute speech on 27 Au-
gust as an indication that the USSR is
preparing to make further concessions to meet the West in

a first-step agreement. The delegate believes that the harsh
tone of Zorin's speech was intended to avoid any impression
that these concessions might be a sign of weakness. However,
he also considers it possible that Moscow may be developing a
propaganda position to be used in the event of a failure to reach
an agreement at London.

  

Comment Zorin's harsh denunciation of Western pro-

posals suggests that Moscow anticipates a

recess at London and is seeking to sharpen the points at issue

in preparation for a full-dress disarmament debate in the UN
General Assembly. There, the USSR hopes to score propaganda

gains and bring pressure on the West for further concessions.

Zorin's strong criticism of the subcommittee's
composition and procedure also suggests a desire for an early
move from the London talks to the General Assembly. The USSR
probably plans to repeat its proposal of last year for an expan-
sion of both the UN Disarmament Commission and its subcom-
mittee to include countries such as India which could be expected
to adopt a sympathetic attitude toward Soviet proposals.

2. PARIS URGES WESTERN COOPERATION ON SYRIA

French Foreign Ministry officials have
made two recent demarches to American
embassy officials urging Western coopera-
tion on Middle Eastern problems. On 24

August the director of Near Eastern and

airs told an American embassy
representative that the French believe it
essential for the Western powers to work

closely together under American leadershii in Siriao He said
that it seemed most likely the West would do nothing, since he

 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
   

25X1

""ruled out"" overt action by the United States alone or in con-
cert with Britain and France. On 26 August the director of
political and economic affairs emphasized the importance of
the fullest possible Western cooperation, even though admitting
that parallel rather than joint action might often be preferable.

25X1
however, the French government
concluded in mid-August that the 1950 tripartite declaration on

maintenance of the status quo in the Near East was obsolete. The
cabinet, in response to a Lebanese request for an opinion, re-
portedly declared that Lebanon is now guaranteed by the Amer-
ican Middle East doctrine, and that if the Lebanese want further

guarantees a new tr1part1te declaration may be necessary.
(NOFORN)

Comment The Foreign Ministry approaches may be a
feeler on the advisability of a new tripartite
declaration. The Baghdad pact, on which France was not origi-
nally consulted, has never set well with Paris, and the French '
government may hope to refurbish its prestige in the Arab world
by a move which would take the spotlight away from both the
Baghdad pact and the American Middle East doctrine.

Britain, like France, evidently considers the
1950 declaration dead, but presumably would welcome any new
joint statement as a token of Washington's willingness to resume
public association with Britain and France regarding the Middle
East. However, such a move, particularly at this time, would
only irritate the Arab states.

2. AMBASSADOR THOMPSON COMMENTS ON ZORIN

DISARMAMENT SPEECH

 

 

Ambassador Thompson in Moscow believes
that Soviet delegate Zorin's speech on 27
August in London was a final statement of

 

 

the Soviet position for the record prior to
winding up work in the UN Disarmament Subcommittee. He
notes that Zorin made it clear the USSR considers the subcom-
mittee too restricted and wants the next step to be an airing of
the entire problem in the UN General Assembly, where India
and other neutral states could participate. He expects the USSR
to suspend serious discussion of disarmament and adopt propa-
ganda positions, while seeking to mobilize public support in or-
der to soften up the West.

Thompson believes the speech was also timed
to get the maximum effect from the announcement of a successful
ICBM test, in order to convey the impression that the USSR is
leading from strength on disarmament.

Comment The British and French delegates to the Lon-

don talks have also expressed the view that
Zorin's speech indicated that the Russians are preparing their
stand for the General Assembly session and that no Soviet dis-
armament concessions can be expected at least until then.

3. MOLOTOV'S APPOINTMENT TO MONGOLIA

Comment on;

 

 

Molotov's appointment as ambassador to

the Mongolian People's Republic appears

to be a shrewd move on Khrushchev's part,
--removing the intransigent '""Old Bolshevik""
from the Soviet internal scene and at the

 

 

same time allaying domestic fears and foreign expectations
that a Stalin-type purge is forthcoming.

This appointment is another indication of
the diverse treatment accorded the. various members of the
""antiparty group'; Molotov's great seniority in the party--51
years of service--and his prestige and age may have given
him some advantage over the others. However, the announce-
ment that the former Soviet ambassador, Vasily Pisarev, will
remain in Ulan Bator as minister and counselor suggests that

1. MARSHAL ZHUKOV REITERATES USSR'S READINESS TO

ACT IF TURKEY INVADES SYRIA

 

25X1A

 

Soviet Defense Minister Zhukov declared
in a speech in Tirana on 24 October: ""We
are ready to strike with determination at
any military adventures near our southern

 

 

borders. In regard to this we have reso-
lutely warned the Turkish government.' He added that the
USSR """"has made appropriate and authoritative declarations
that if war is declared on Syria, the Soviet Union will not re-
main with its hands folded. ""

Zhukov's allusion to ""appropriate and au-
thoritative declarations' apparently refers to Gromyko's 16
October offer of Soviet forces to take part in UN action against
Turkey should that country invade Syria, and a similar declara-
tion by TASS on 18 October.

Zhukov told another Albanian audience,on 21
October, ""The imperialists are trying to unleash another war
but, if necessary, we can strike an even stronger blow and ac-

 

cording to an even wider plan. ""

2. SAUDI-TURKISH TALKS

 

 

The talks between King Saud and Turkish
Minister of State Zorlu appear to have
established cordial contact between the
two governments. Saud probably now
feels somewhat closer to his objective
of parrying intervention in Syria. How-
ever, the Turkish assurance, expressed
in the joint Saudi-Turkish communiqué, -
that Ankara harbors 'a firm desire to

 

 

safeguard the independence, territorial
security, and national sovereignty of Syria, "" could be read
as a justification of Turkish intervention to keep Syria out

of the status of a dependent Soviet satellite.

King Saud told Ambassador Wadsworth
on 25 October that he believed the United States should leave
to Turkey the task of exposing the Soviet role in Syria. He
suggested Ankara could say it has massed troops on the
frontier for this ""very cogent' reason.

3. EGYPTIAN REINFORCEMENT OF SINAI REPORTED

 

 

Egyptian forces in unspecified numbers, but
described as ""large, ' are reported to have

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moved into the Sinai area approximately one DIA
week ago, 25X 1

. Sev- 25X1
eral units of armor, artillery, and Inramncry pre-

viously stationed in the Suez Canal zone were

 

 

not observed during a reconnaissance of the
area by the attaché on 19 October. These units have not been
noted in other areas of Egypt, and it seems unlikely that they
have gone to Syria.

Last spring Egypt moved about 8, 450 men
into the Sinai Peninsula where they were deployed defensively
near key communication. centers, and also served to control
the population. Deployment and supply of a larger force in
Sinai now is possible as a result of the virtual completion of
major repairs to the roads, most of which were destroyed by
the Israelis during the 1956 hostilities. Repair of the coastal
and central routes restores highway access to the Egyptian-
Israeli border and eliminates the buffer zone that existed while
the roads were in disrepair. Egypt had about 25,000 troops in
Sinai at the time of the Israeli attack in late October 1956.

Reintroduétion of major Egyptian forces 'into

_ Sinai would be facilitated by international preoccupation with de-

velopments in Syria. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has indicated
in connection with other Arab-Israeli problems that his govern-
ment does not wish to complicate further the present situation.

4. THE SITUATION IN GUATEMALA

 

25X1A The military junta which took over in
Guatemala early on 24 October may not
be able to retain power long. Strikes
and demonstrations by followers of
presidential aspirant Ydigoras Fuentes
continue, and the junta, which seeks to
appear politically neutral, is weakened
by factionalism in the army. Violence
may ensue.

 

 

 

The junta, supported by many anti-

Ydigoras officers,| 25X1

,1's angered by what it interpreted as an ulfi-
matum from Ydigoras after both sides had tentatively
agreed on a political compromise proposed by congres-
sional mediators. Guillermo Flores Avendano, consti-
tutional successor to ousted interim president Gonzalez,
was to be named interim president until new elections
could be held on 24 November.

 

 

 

Ydigoras seems to feel that things are
going his way and that by continued pressure he can become
president. He would probably win any new elections, but
apparently prefers to have the 20 October votes recounted
to show that he has already been elected. He feels confident
that important army leaders are on his side, and his supporters
are demanding the resignation of Colonel Oscar Mendoza, presi-
dent of the junta, whom they regard as a remnant of the ousted
regime.

SOVIET NUCLEAR-POWERED AIRCRAFT

 

 

The director of training for satellite
reactor technicians at the Dubna lab-
oratory stated recently to a US official
that the USSR would soon have a nuclear-

 

 

powered aircraft. There have been several similar state-
ments by Soviet officials. '

It is probable that the USSR has an air-
craft nuclear propulsion program which may be in an ad-
vanced stage. If it has applied an all-out effort to this
program, it is possible that a subsonic test aircraift could
be flown with nuclear power during the 40th anniversary
celebrations on 7 November, although it is more likely that
such an aircraft would not be ready until late next year.
While such an aircraft would not at this time have perform-
ance characteristics of military significance, Soviet prop-.
aganda would certainly treat its flight as further proof of

 

Communist scientific superiority over the West.

1. AMBASSADOR THOMPSON'S VIEWS ON RECENT

COMMUNIST BLOC PRONOUNCEMENTS

 

 

Ambassador Thompson in Moscow be-
lieves party presidium member Furtseva's
address on 26 November before a Moscow

 

 

party meeting shows that a primary Soviet
objective during the recent high-level Communist meetings in
Moscow was to obtain clear reacknowledgment of Soviet lead-
ership of the international Communist movement by all Sino-
Soviet bloc parties. Furtseva emphasized this theme at least
five times, and declared that such recognition is important,
""because revisionists in certain foreign Communist parties ap-
plied much effort to discredit the successes of the Soviet Union
and to undermine the authority of our party.

Ambassador Thompson notes that one of
the major aims of the Soviet leaders over the past year has
been to restore the momentum given the international Commu-
nist movement by the February 1956 CPSU 20th party congress,
but disrupted by the de-Stalinization campaign and the Hungar-
ian revolt. Moscow has since been seeking means to prevent
a repetition of situations in which foreign Communists were un-
certain about the party line and even went so far in some in-
stances as to criticize the USSR.

Ambassador Thompson believes that Moscow
has clearly outmaneuvered Belgrade. Among Tito's potential
allies, Mao was loud in his affirmation of Soviet leadership;
Gomulka was apparently pleased with concessions on """"national
peculiarities'; while Togliatti was presumably reassured by
affirmation of the doctrine of peaceful transition to Socialism
and by the failure to revive any international Communist organ-
ization. In the ambassador's view, it is an open question whether
Moscow will be able to keep the entire Communist movement in
line, although the situation now tends to favor the Kremlin.

2. YUGOSLAV-SOVIET RELATIONS COOL

 

25X1A

Yugoslav-Soviet relations appear to
have cooled distinctly since Zhukov's
ouster. Belgrade has become increas-
ingly disillusioned with the Soviet lead-
ership, and Moscow has been treating
Yugoslavia with reserve,

 

 

The French Foreign Ministry reported
on 30 November that during a courtesy .
call, the new Yugoslav ambassador to Paris was quite def-
inite in expressing President Tito's disenchantment with
Khrushchev. He said that Yugoslav Vice President Kardelj
had returned from Moscow with a """"most unfavorable impres-
sion of Khrushchev and the general atmosphere.!' In what ap-
pears in part as an effort to redress Yugoslavia's balance be-
tween East and West, the ambassador added that Kardelj
deeply resented Soviet attempts to push the Yugoslavs into
following the Soviet line in a way '""all too reminiscent of
Cominform practices)

 

Major Moscow dailies carried noncommital
articles about Yugoslavia's national day on 29 November in con-
trast to the more general attention given to Albania's national
holiday on the same date. Although the Yugoslav embassy's cele-
bration in Moscow on this occasion was attended by Khrushchev
and other top Soviet leaders, Soviet propaganda only noted the
Yugoslav holiday in a polite but reserved fashion. The Amer-
ican embassy in Moscow views the '""'rather perfunctory' tele-
gram Soviet President Voroshilov sent Tito in conjunction with
the event as one ""'superficially correct"" and as a reflection of
present Yugoslav-Soviet relations in which """"no great enthusiasm
is apparent on either side.""

3. RUSSIANS REFUSE VISAS FOR TRANSIT OF EAST GERMANY

 

 

The Soviet embassy in Warsaw, in another
move probably designed to force the West-
ern allies to deal directly with the East

German regime, has refused to act on re-

 

 

cent applications from American embassy personnel in Warsaw
for Soviet transit visas for travel in East Germany. In explan-
ation of their refusal, Soviet officials stated they have no auth-
orization from the East German government to issue transit
visas. Although formerly most requests were granted within a
week or 10 days, recent requests have been in for as long as
two weeks without action.

Under four power agreements, the Russians
are responsible for the documentation of official Allied person-
nel traveling in East Germany. The Soviet embassy in East
Berlin, however, has issued visas permitting American offi-
cials to travel in East Germany on only two occasions since
October 1956. The Russians, in refusing to issue visas, have
hinted that approval would probably be granted if American re- -
quests were addressed directly to East German officials.

4. BONN REFUSES TO CONTINUE PAYMENTS FOR
BRITISH TROOPS '

 

 

   
  
  

onn's adamant refusal to negotiate on
rontinuing payments to defray local ex-
enses of British forces in Germany
1fter 31 March 1958 has caused London
0 invoke special NATO and WEU provi-
sions concerning relief of financial dif-
iculties arising from stationing forces
in other member countries. The dis-

 

pute will raise anew the divisive issue of future British troop
levels less than two weeks before the 16-18 December NATO
meetings.

Bonn's attitude is much firmer than in
previous years, when it accepted compromise arrangements
for contributing to the support of all foreign troops in West
Germany. Indicative of the new German concentration on
building up the Bundeswehr was the expression by a respon-
sible Foreign Ministry official of the greatest indifference
regarding the presence or absence of British troops. Adenauer
has recently shown alarm at the cost of the German build-up.

German intransigence, which may be ex-
pected to continue even if NATO studies point to the advisa-
bility of special aid to Britain, will probably lead London to
consider further reductions of the 50,000-man force it planned
to leave in Germany after March 1959. Presumably, London in
any event will no longer offer to station in Germany the 5,000-
man element of the British strategic reserve which it had linked
to German agreement to pay $140,000,000 in support costs for
all British troops. | |

6. NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN ANGLO-SAUDI RELATIONS

 

25X1A

Britain is pursuing efforts to resume
diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia

in order to work toward a settlement of
outstanding area problems. London has
asked the Iraqis to explore Saud's views
on the requisite preconditions during King
Faysal's current visit to Riyadh. .

 

 

 

King Saud has previously appeared inter-
ested, but his present attitude is unclear. Saud told the Amer-
ican ambassador on 24 November that ""'up to now Britain has
done nothing to meet problems pending between us"" and that

he saw no point in resuming relations until it did so. British
officials think, however, that Saud, not wishing to be isolated,
will be more inclined to reach agreement if Anglo-Egyptian
relations are re-established--as now appears likely.

The Buraimi QOasis, which has been occu-
pied by British-led local forces since late 1955, remains the
outstanding dispute. In September, the Saudis proposed through
an-intermediary four possible solutions, including the creation
of a neutral zone in the Buraimi area.

The Shah, | I 25X1
| has 25X1

voiced his disillusionment with the Bagh-

dad pact. He made thinly veiled threats

that his country may withdraw from the

pact's military committee unless it re-

ceives substantial military and financial

assistance. In this connection he again

pressed for American adherence to the

pact.

The Shah proposes to tell the Baghdad

pact council meetmg in January that without additional aid,
Iran's forces cannot hold positions chosen by the pact's m11-
itary committee and must accordmgly develop plans limited
to Iran's",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003400260001-5,/meta-55800,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1957

1. TWO SOVIET PARTY SECRETARIES RELINQUISH

 

LOCAL POSTS

 

 

25X1A

 

 

 

Release of Yekaterina Furtseva and Alexei
Kirichenko from their local party posts in
Moscow and the Ukrainian Republic respec-
tively, to free them for their duties in the

 

 

central party secretariat, is not a demotion
for either. It is a further indication of the increased responsibil-
ities being assumed by the central party secretariat under First
Secretary Khrushchev.

At an extraordinary 26 December plenary
meeting of the Ukrainian central committee, attended by the
visiting Khrushchev, Kirichenko was replaced as local first
secretary by his former second in command, Nikolai Podgorny.
Podgorny served during World War II as a USSR Deputy Commis-
sar for the Food Industry and after 1950 as party first secretary
in Kharkov Oblast. In June 1953 he became second secretary of
the Ukrainian party organization and was elected to the all-union
central committee at the 20th party congress in February 1956.

Furtseva's replacement in Moscow, 50-year-
old Vladimir Ustinov, is a comparative unknown. He is appar-
ently a mechanical engineer and World War II production chief
who became increasingly active in party affairs in postwar years,
and from 1950 until January 1954 was a district party chief in
Moscow. In 1952 he was a delegate to the 19th party congress.
Since then he may have attended the Higher Party School in Mos-
cow where promising party executives are trained.

Ustinov was elevated to his present post over
the heads of two prominent Moscow city party secretaries, Ivan
Marchenko, a full member of the central committee, and Sergei
Butusov, a candidate member of the central committee. His back-
ground as an engineer may have been a factor in his assignment to
head the industrial Moscow area which, as a result of Khrushchev's
industrial reorganization, constitutes a separate economic region.

. SOVIET PARTY SHAKE-UP IN KAZAKHSTAN

 

 

 

 

 

Party presidium member Nikolai Belyayev
has replaced Ivan Yakovlev as party boss
in the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
The shift, presumably decided upon at the

 

 

25X1A

party central committee plenum in Moscow
on 16-17 December, received pro forma approval at a Kazakh
party meeting on 26 December.

Belyayev has had many years' experience
in the agricultural field and may have been assigned to the
Kazakh post to help boost production in the Kazakh part of the
new lands area, He has presumably been relieved as central
party secretary (in charge of agriculture)--a post he held since
July 1955--and as deputy chairman of the central committee's
""Buro for the RSFSR'""--to which he was assigned in February
1956.

 

 

 

25X1

 

during the debate on Zhukov in the October central committee

plenum, a group of extremists led by Belyayev took a position

contrary to that of Khrushchev and wanted to extend the purge

to all party and government officials guilty of the ''cult of per-

sonality.' elyayev was considered a 25X1
rising star, and in his view would be Khrushchev's eventual suc-

cessor. Belyayev has been retained on the party presidium, but

he has lost a direct voice in Moscow affairs and may have suf-

fered a decline in political stature.

 

 

 

 

In addition to Yakolev, the Kazakh party's
second secretary, Nikolai Zhurin, was fired. No reason was
given for the changes, but the absence from the announcement
of the usual phrase, ''in connection with his transfer to other
work,"" suggests that both Yakovlev, a full member of the cen-
tral committee, and Zhurin, a candidate member of the central
committee, were dropped in disfavor, 25X1A

4, THAI LEADER FACING PROLONGED PERIOD

OF INCAPACITATION

 

 

arshal Sarit, the leader of Thailand's
ruling military group, suffered a severe
internal hemorrhage on 24 December

nd his doctors state he must have a major

 

operation. Sarif's aide approached the American Embassy on
26 December for assistance in arrangmg medical treatment in
the United States

 

! , | 25X6
| Sarit's incapacitation

comes at a time when the military group and associated civil-

ian politicians are heavily engaged in organizing a new govern-

ment in the wake of the 15 December parliamentary elections.

During his absence from the scene, Premier-designate Thanom,

who ranks just below Sarit in the military group hierarchy,

will probably be Thailand's principal leader. Thanom may have

greater difficulty than his chief, however, in keeping the more

ambitious of his colleagues within the military group in line.

2. SOVIET HIERARCHY MAY UNDERGO FURTHER CHANGES

 
   
    

A - diplomat recently stated that
Kliment Voroshilov, chairman of the
Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet,
will retire after the March Supreme
oviet elections. He also said that Premier Bulganin may

receive a new job.

It has been frequently reported that
Voroshilov, who will be 77 next month, is becoming increas-
ingly senile. The election of a new Supreme Soviet Presid-
ium after the general elections would provide an opportunity
for him to retire with honor.

rivate statements by Soviet officials,
s well as Premier Bulganin's new
etters, reflect Moscow's increasing
confidence that West European pres-

 

sures for new East-West negotiations will either force
eventual American agreement to a heads-of-government

- meeting or encourage its NATO allies to make independ-

ent moves toward an accommodation with the USSR.

DAILY BRIEF

 

 

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

 

 

*USSR--Summit talks: Moscow has abandoned

its adamant opposition to a foreign ministers' confer-
ence to prepare for summit talks. Gromyko has given
an aide-memoire to Ambassador Thompson proposing
a meeting on this level in April to work out an agenda
for a summit conference, determine its composition,
and fix its time and place,

 

 

 

 

- Soviet approach to King Saud: The USSR is prob-
ably using the 27 February visit to King Saud by the
Soviet ambassador to Syria to make exploratory of-
fers of Soviet support and to request the establish-
ment of formal relations. Saud has previously been

firm in his refusal to do business with the Soviet
Union.

North Korea: The Pyongyang regime still insists
that the United Nations Command in the Military Armi-
stice Commission is not competent to negotiate the hi-

 

jacked airliner issue, but the Communists have dropped
o their demand for ""direct negotiations"" with South Korea
as a prerequisite to releasing the passengers. The Com-
munists seem to have moved to a position which makes
- release contingent on some form of government-to~gov-
ernment approach by the United States, West Germany, ..
and South Korea. | | 25X1A

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Moscow propaganda on SEATO meeting: The strong
TASS statement attacking the SEATO meeting in Manila
furthers Soviet propaganda efforts to discredit US motives
in Asia. By contrasting Soviet proposals for nuclear-free
zones and a '""collective peace pact in Asia"" with alleged US-
SEATO attempts to set up nuclear and rocket bases in Europe
and Asia, Moscow seeks to generate Asian support for a sum-
mit meeting. The USSR made similar attacks on the recent
NATO and Baghdad Pact meetipgs. | 25x1

Soviet-Yugoslav relations: A stinging attack on Soviet
Marshal Konev, accusing him--apparently with little justifi-
cation-=of ignoring the Yugoslav contribution to victory in
World War 11, breaks the uneasy truce which has existed be-
tween Belgrade and Moscow since last fall's Communist con-
ference. The deliberate gesture may have been designed to
enhance Tito",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003600080001-3,/meta-55800,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

Indonesia: Although the central government has regained
bt - control of Medan, North Sumatra, the dissident troops with-
| drew intact and are headed westward toward the Tapanuli
- area, where they will probably link up with other antigovern-
ment forces. They apparently felt compelled to vacate the
city because expected reinforcements failed to appear. Mean-
. 25X1A while, government forces have occupied Rengat, the Stanvac
5 5X1 oil center in Central Sumatra. | |

tive elections in the Ryukyus show that conservatives have

seats, apparently were unable to gain significant support

USSR: Ambassador Thompson reports that reaction
in Moscow to Khrushchev's assumption of the premiership,
so far as it can be gauged, is one of surprise, disappoint-
ment, and apprehension. Official reaction has been re-
ceived thus far only from Poland and Yugoslavia. The
Polish party daily ironically points out that the high spot

N of the Soviet leader's career came with his 1956 declara-
tion on ""The Cult of Personality and Its Consequences, ""
Belgrade has taken a noncommittal position, receiving
thenews with """"sympathy.",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003600250001-4,/meta-55800,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

25X1 DAILY BRIEF

 

I, THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

USSR - Summit tactics: On 9 April Deputy Foreign
Minister Kuznetsov gave Ambassador Thompson an official
reply to the 31 March Western proposals, but almost im-
mediately withdrew it following a sudden telephone call,

The note appeared to propose that the ambassadors in Mos-
cow discuss only such arrangements for a foreign ministers'
7o meeting as time, place, and composition. The confusion may
~ have been caused by the fact that Premier Khrushchev was to
return to Moscow the next day. Kuznetsov reiterated orally
that the USSR thought the West wanted preliminary negotia-
tions in order to reach an impasse and prevent a summit

conference, while Moscow thought a summit meeting would
be useful whether or not it could reach decisions. b 25X1A

 

 

25X1A

 

 

 

Hungary - USSR: The cold reception accorded Khru-
shchev on his Hungarian visit must have shattered his be-
lief that the scars of the 1956 Soviet intervention could be
removed by his personal magnetism, He had earlier told
UN Secretary General Hammarskjold that he felt confident

N his trip would show he was not unpopular in Hungary. The
alternately threatening and defensive tone of his 8 and 9
April speeches contrasts with his initial approach, which
was more temperate and controlled, and suggests that the
indifference of the Hungarians was an important factor in

55X his loss of temper. | | 25X1A

Soviet flyby practice: The Soviet Air Force has started
practice ilights over Moscow in preparation for the flyby
which is a feature of the Soviet May Day parade in Red Square.
So far only known types of Soviet fighter and bomber aircraft
Sl have been observed. At least seven canvas-covered missiles
have been noted on trailers in Moscow, suggesting that a mis-
sile display--such as occurred in Moscow last November--
probably will be repeated. | | 25X1A

DAILY BRIEF

 

I, THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

Czechoslovakia: Prague's implementation of an eco-
nomic decentralization program this year has caused popu-
lar discontent to spread. Over 100,000 have been hit by
labor relocation plans and large-scale reductions of the

%4 central administrative staffs, but the population does not
seem generally disposed to make trouble. Within the par-
ty, underlying discontent--possibly extending into the top
echelon--is hidden from the public behind an appearance
of solidarity, Serious differences are not likely to break
into the open before or during the party congress in June.

Japanese - Communist bloc relations: Japanese Prime
Minister Kishi has been placed in an extremely difficult po-
sition in a critical pre-election period by Communist China's
refusal to carry out a private trade agreement with Japan and
by the USSR's delay in agreeing on a salmon quota for 1958.
Kishi will be vulnerable to charges that he has frustrated wide-
spread Japanese sentiment for increased trade with the Com-
munist mainland and failed to protect vital fishing interests.
These allegations are certain to cost him support in the elec-

 

. tions-anticipated in May and to weaken his control of the gov-

ernment and the ruling conservative party. If Kishi should
accede to Peiping's demands on the trade agreement, Tajpei
would probably sever diplomatic relations with Tokyo.

 

 

 

 

Egypt: Nasir, apparently stung by broadcasts against o
him which he attributes to ""Western radios,"" has[ | 25X1
threatened to take the issue of clandestine broadcasting to

the UN Security Council. He intends to begin clandestine

broadcasts to counter '""those of the Baghdad Pact."" The

Cairo press and radio are strongly attacking the pro-

Western governments in Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon.

 

 

 

 

 

Morocco - United Arab Republic: King Mohamed V and
his government are seriously concerned over Egyptian propa-
ganda activities against the government and the monarchy.
The King is reported to have ordered his minister of hational
economy, who began an official visit in Cairo on 5 April, to o
make a direct approach to Nasir, including the threat to ex- 25X1A
pel all Egyptian teachers from Morocco. | |

 

 

 

Greece: Greek political alignments for the national elec-
tions on 11 May are becoming clearer. The Communist-front
EDA will probably enter the elections alone. The Liberal par-
ty, which ran second in the 1956 elections, is expected to run
as a single party rather than as part of a coalition. Former

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Czechoslovakia

The program for economic reform recently begun
in Czechoslovakia has caused widespread popular dis-
content. Over one hundred thousand persons have been
affected by the labor relocation plans, and the lives of
several hundred thousands, primarily in Prague and
other cities, have been unsettled. Furthermore the gov-
ernment has renewed last year's collectivization offen-
sive, with the intention of increasing the area of agri-
cultural socialization from the present 65 percent to
more than 80 percent by the end of 1959. It hopes to
socialize all agriculture in the country within the next
three years. The collectivization campaign will be
carried out primarily in Slovakia and may intensify
existing separatism there.

There are no signs, however, that the population
is any more disposed than in the past to make trouble.
The regime is. alert to this dissatisfaction and has in-
dicated, both through propaganda and a vigilance cam-
paign specifically directed against Slovak nationalism,
that it will permit no interference or challenge.

The American Embassy in Prague believes that
rumors of underlying discontent in the Communist
party, possibly extending into the top echelon, could
have some basis in fact, although the party continues
to present an unruffled and united front. The fact that
party boss Novotny, who was the personal choice of
Khrushchev, is administering the current Soviet-type
economic program in Czechoslovakia will probably
prevent the emergence of any serious differences,
either before or during the party congress in June.

Kishi Government Threatened by Pressures From Commu-
nist China and USSR

 

Communist China's refusal to implement a private trade
agreement with Japan and Soviet intransigence on terms for
a 1958 salmon quota in northwest Pacific waters have placed
Prime Minister Kishi in an extremely difficult position in a
critical pre-election period.

Peiping has attacked the Japanese Government's an-
nouncement of 9 April that in supporting the trade agreement,
Japan was not recognizing the ""right"" of Communist China
to fly its national flag over a projected trade mission in Ja-
pan. Peiping, rather than accepting Japan's assertion that
the flying of the flag could not legally be prevented, desires
clear public endorsement of the flag provision, undoubtedly
to keep alive Japan's rift with Nationalist China over this
issue.

Peiping's rejection of Japan's position has made Kishi
vulnerable to charges that he has frustrated widespread
Japanese sentiment for increased trade with the mainland.
This charge is certain to cost Kishi support if elections are
held in May as anticipated, and may ultimately result in his
replacement by another Liberal-Democratic prime minis-
ter more inclined toward closer relations with Communist
China.

Kishi's reversal of his present position, on the other
hand, would probably cause Chiang Kai-shek to carry out
his threat to sever diplomatic relations with Japan.

Moscow has offered to increase the Japanese salmon
quota for 1958 from 80,000 to 100,000 tons, but Japan de-
sires a still higher quota and is firmly opposed to Saviet
closure of the Sea of Okhotsk to Japanese salmon{fishing.
MoscoW apparently believes that continued delay on this

Cyprus: Tension on Cyprus continues with acts of vio-

lence and sabotage. The wounding of a British serviceman

on 14 April was the first attack on a Briton in more than a

¢ L0 year and may foreshadow more serious attacks. There have
been riots in detention camps, a 24-hour general strike, and
an expanding boycott of British goods accompanied by threats
and warnings. The Turkish Cypriot underground has demanded
the immediate withdrawal of Governor Foot because of his al.
leged pro-Greek activities. Active diplomatic efforts to solve 25X1
the Cyprus problem are in abeyance pending the 11 May Greek B
elections, '

_740 Moscow probably to be briefed on First Deputy Premier
Mikoyan's forthcoming visit to West Germany from 25 to
28 April. Pervukhin is scheduled to return to Berlin on
24 or 25 April. There is a possibility, however, that
Pervukhin's recallis connected with recent vituperative

The Arab Union and Kuwait

 

The Ruler of Kuwait has rejected a British suggestion
that his oil-rich sheikhdom join:the Arab Union recently
formed by Iraq and Jordan. He fears that such a move
would provoke trouble among the majority of Kuwaitis, who
are strongly pro-Nasir, and would provide an opportunity
for the United Arab Republic to undermine him. Kuwait's
population, which includes a significant number of Palestin-
ian Arabs, is especially hostile to the Nuri Said ""absolutist""
regime in Iraq, while the Kuwaiti ruling clan has tradition-
ally feared Iraqi territorial clesigns on Kuwait.

Kuwait's great wealth has been regarded by the Arab
Union leaders as a means by which they could compensate
for the weakness of the Jordanian economy.

Since Kuwait's rejection of the Arab Union bid, Iraqi
Foreign Minister Jamali has asked the United States and
Great Britain to urge Lebanese leaders to adhere to the
union on the grounds that Lebanon's membership would
strengthen the union and stabilize the Lebanese internal
situation. To add such an inflammatory issues to.the exist-
ing controversy in Lebanon over President Chamoun's am-
bition to legalize another term for himself probably would 25X1A
touch off more widespread strife there.

Kishi Decides on May Elections

 

Japanese Prime Minister Kishi and leaders of the
ruling Liberal-Democratic party have decided to dis-
solve the lower house of the Diet about 25 April and hold
national elections on 22 May. The elections will be the
first popular test for Kishi and of his policy of close co-
operation with the United States.

Most political observers believe the Socialists, who
hold approximately one third of the 467 seats in the power-
ful lower house, will make some gains. K the Socialists
gain as many as 15 or 20 seats, this would erode Kishi's
control of the government and of his conservative party,
result in renewed factionalism among the conservatives,
and force the prime minister into a stronger stand against
the US on some issues, notably Okinawa, and into closer
relations with the Communist bloc.

In large part, Kishi's control of the conservatives may
be determined prior to elections when he attempts to limit
the number of conservative candidates in Japan's system
of multi-seat districts. His failure to achieve this objec-
tive probably would split the conservative vote and allow
the Socialists to win additional seats.

Although Kishi has failed to develop into a popular
figure, he has a record of considerable achievement in
office, and he may believe that his government's handling
of the controversial private trade agreement with Commu-
nist China, the fishery talks with the USSR, and the nego-
tiations with South Korea, have created a favorable election
climate for the conservatives at this time. Final solutions
of these problems have not been reached, however, and ad-
verse developments prior to 22 May could strongly influ-
ence the voters. | |

Iceland Threatens Drastic Action on Territorial
Limits Issue

 

Anti- American and neutralist sentiment may heighten
in Iceland as a result of the US position taken at the Geneva
conference on the law of the sea. The United States has
proposed that territorial waters be extended to six miles,
with fishing rights in a six-mile strip beyond largely re-
served to the littoral state. Iceland, whose economy is en-
tirely dependent on fish, desires a 12-mile limit with the
possibility of further extensicn in special circumstances.

The foreign minister has vigorously protested to the
United States Embassy that the public is so inflamed that
incalculable harm may be done to Icelandic-American rela~
tions and to Iceland's attitude towards NATO. He also stated
that in the event the outcome of the conference is unsatisfac-
tory Iceland would extend its territorial waters to the 12-mile
limit and would attempt to enforce it.

The US Embassy confirms the gravity of public reac-
tion, citing press emphasis on the US ""stab in the back""
theme, Under the stress of emotion the chauvinistic Ice-
landers are capable of interfering with the smooth func-
tioning of the US-manned NATO airbase at Keflavik and
blocking further cooperation in defense matters. They might
even reopen negotiations, discontinued in December 1956;
on the withdrawl of US forces. The Icelandic delegate at
Geneva has on several occasions told the American dele-
gate that unless Iceland",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003600440001-3,/meta-46200,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

Poland: Gomulka's impending visit to Hungary and
Rumania, a trip which may also include Bulgaria, is the
latest of a series of moves by Poland during the past
month to emphasize bloc solidarity. These moves have
- includéd adopting a position more in conformity with the
Ho Soviet interpretation of the Hungarian revolution, taking
the lead in the bloc campaign against West German nu-
clear armament, and boycotting the Yugoslav party con-
gress despite Gomulka's known sympathies. Such actions
in support of Soviet bloc policy may have been taken by
Gomulka to enhance his status among bloc leaders and
toimprove relations with the USSR. | |

 

USSR - Lebanon: Soviet Ambassador Kiktev has re-
newed Moscow's oifer of unconditional economic assistance
to Lebanon. Similar offers which have not been specific,
e o have been made to Jordan and to Saudi Arabia as part of
o Moscow's discreet effort to extend its economic relation-

. ships with pro-Western Arab states. Thisooffer is ap-
parently timed to exploit unrest in Lebanon in connection
with President Chamoun's intention to seek re-election
and is intended generally to:encourage opposition to Leba-

25X1 non's pro-Western policies. 25X1A

Israel-Jordan: Tension between Israelis and Arabs

make final preparations| for the large military parade
and other celebrations scheduled for 24 April. The pres-
ence of 8izable concentrations of troops and armor inboth
the Israeli and Jordanian sectors, in violation of the Gen-
eral Armistice Agreement, creates the possibility of seri-
ous incidents. The presence of large crowds of civilians
near the armistice lines could also lead to clashes.

Suez Canal compensation: The British directors of
the old Suez Canal Company have been instructed by the
Foreign Office to stand firmly for acceptance of Nasir's
offer of approximately $65,000,000 at a company board
meeting to be held on 22 April. Since both the British
and French governments view Nasir's offer favorably,
the majority of the shargholders of the company seem
likely to accept the offer of compensationffor the com-
pany's nationalized property in Egypt. |

Cyprus: The British have postponed further discus-
sions with Athens pending the Greek national elections
on 11 May, and are now trying unsuccessfully to moderate
the Turkish demand for partition. In the meantime, they
are refusing to make any public: policy statement on Cy-
prus. The British at present are more fearful of violence
by Turks than by Greeks, and plan to authorize demonstra-
tions on 23 April, Turkish Youth Day, despite the danger
that both communal violence and a renewed EOKA campaign
may flare up. |

Israeli-Jordanian Tension in Jerusalem

Increased Israeli-Jordanian tension in Jerusalem, as
a conseguence of troop: -.movements into the area by hpth
sides, willrddd to the difficulties of avoiding a serious inci-
dent durmg the large Israeli military parade and anniversary
celebrations scheduled for 24 April.

During the past week, Israel has moved at least 74 tanks
and other armored vehicles, plus¢field artillery, into Jerusa-
lem in violation of the General Armistice Agreement. Be-
tween 4,000 and 5,000 Israeli troops have been brought into
the city.

The Jordanian Government, probably fearful of the propa-
ganda consequences of not taking a firm position against this
violation of the armistice agreement, announced on 20 April
that Jordanian troops and military equipment would be moved
into the Jerusalem area in sufficient strength to redress the
balance of forces. About 4,000 troops are available for the
move, including an infantry brigade and two tank battalions
with 60 tanks. The Jordanian Government has been advised
by UN Truce Superviser Von Horn that about 150,000 Israe-
li civilians will be along the route of the parade in the vicini-
ty of the armistice lines,

The Israelis also plan to use searchlights from Israel
to illuminate a Star of David on the Haddasa hospital on
Mount:Scopus, an Israeli-held enclave inside Jordan.. Jor-
danian Foreign Minister Rifai has stated that these search-
lights would be 'knocked out."" The celebrations also are
to include a fireworks display on Mofint Scopus. Israel is
reported to have agreed, however, not to have an aerial
fly-by.

General Von Horn has obtained agreement from both

DAILY BRIEF

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

Soviet summit tactics: The Soviet response to the
AmeTican Arctic inspection proposal indicates that the
USSR is making a further effort to force the convening
of a summit conference on its own terms. Gromyko's

warning that the USSR would ""send rockets to repel the

% imminent threat"" if American bombers violated Soviet
frontiers is an attempt to increase pressure on the United
States for a summit meeting by trying to create the im-
pression that the danger of war has seriously increased.
Sobolev reiterated Soviet opposition to giving priority to
measures against surprise attacks, emphasizing that all
disarmament matters should be discussed at the summit
rather than in the UN Securitv Council where the USSRis
in the minority. 25X

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN

6 May 1958

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Communist China: Peiping's recent condemnation of
the Yugoslav party program is the strongest reaction to
come from any bloc capital to date. Describing the Yugo-
slav '""road to socialism' as a ""'surrender to capitalism""
and the Yugoslavs themselves as similar to ""reactionaries
of all countries,' the Chinese Communist newspaper,
People's Daily, states the '""1948 Cominform resolution was
correct and calls for '""open and uncompromising"" criticism
of the Yugoslav program. Peiping's statement is intended
to leave no doubt among satellite as well as Yugoslav lead-
ers that the Chinese Communists will support Moscow's

 

efforts to check any threat to bloc unity.
(Page 1)

 

 

 

II. ASIA-AFRICA

Indonesia: Dissident forces under Lt. Col. Sumual,
commander in North Celebes, have made a successful land-
ing at Djailoloon Halmahera Island, and have taken the air-
field there. An army spokesman in Djakarta claims the
North Celebes dissidents have ""asked for negotiations.""

DAILY BRIEF

25X1
LATE ITEM

 

 

 

*USSR central committee meeting: The Soviet news
agency TASS has announced that the central committee of
the USSR Communist party convened on 6 and 7 May to dis-
uss higher priorities for the production of consumer googds.
While a part of the session was probably devoted to this
eneral economic problem, it seems likely that such press-
ing internal and foreign policy issues as the manner in
which Yugoslavia could be brought to heel by the blcc as a
whole, played a significant part in prompting the meeting.

A preliminary analysis of Moscow press coverage su; tests
that central committee debate resulted in a sort of compro-
mise--a softer internal economic policy of intreasing con-
sumer goods production, and a tougher Communist bloc at-
titude toward Yugoslavia. , 25X

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

*Polish position in the Yugoslav dispute: Pravda's re-
publication of Peiping's denunciation of Tito tightens the
squeeze on Gomulka, who would like to avoid taking an un-
equivocal stand on the Yugoslav ""heresies."" Gomulka's re-
nunciation of these """"heresies"" would tend to compromise
the program on which the Polish leader's regime is based.
Gomulka's current tour of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania
offers an opportunity for the USSR to bring further pressure
on him. Tito's projected visit to Poland in late May, which
was set up on a party as well as state level, increases the
difficulties of Gomulka's position. Western press reports .
indicate that Polish C.mmunists, presumably liberals, have
reacted to the Chinese denunciation by attributing it to an
effort by Peiping to support a so-called ""Molotov faction's'
Stalinist line in intra-bloc relations.

local Communist and Sino-Soviet bloc exploitation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Israel-Jordan: The issue of Israeli access to the Mt.
Scopus area of Jerusalem has again been raised by Jordan's
/L0 refusal to allow two Israelis to accompany a convoy into
the area. The Israeli foreign minister has decided that the
convoy will not proceed without the two Israelis. She states
Jordan has no right to challenge convoy personnel.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Syria: Symptoms of a local competition for power in
the Syrian region of the UAR are appearing. Rightist as well
as pro-Soviet newspapers are attacking Socialist leader Haw-
rani, UAR vice président who heads the Arab Socialist Res-

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR-Africa: The USSR is intensifying its drive to
persuade African students to accept trips and scholar-
ships in the Soviet Union. Soviet Embassy officials in
Cairo are actively pressing these offers, and at least
50 African students have apparently left for Moscow
during the last eight months.

II. ASIA-AFRICA

*Lebanon: The army continues to hold the upper hand
in Beirut and other major urban centers, but the security
situation in the countryside has deteriorated further. Army
commander General Shihab fears that opposition elements,
abetted by infiltrators from Syria, may soon attempt to
move on Beirut from outlying areas. President Chamoun
n1ay, in the light of Shihab's assessment that the army's

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN

15 May 1958

DAILY BRIEF

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

 

Poland: Warsaw's latest response to Soviet pressure
in the Dloc dispute with Yugoslavia is a Trybuna Luda edi-
torial condemning some aspects of Tito's party program but
treating Yugoslavia as a ""fraternal socialist state."" Go- _
mulka's position creates a dilemma for the Kremlin. Fur- e
ther Soviet pressure on Poland could threaten the principles
of independence on which the continued tenure of Gomulka
depends.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1I. ASIA-AFRICA

 

o Lebanon: Sporadic street fighting and sabotage have
continued. The army has apparently maintained control of
most of Beirut, but has not tried to reassert authority in
rural areas. Opposition groups continue to receive money
and arms from UAR sources. Chamoun's opponents
may well mount a new effort against the strained security
forces if the results of recent political maneuvering do not
satisfy them.

Burma: Premier U Nu has gained the support of the
Communist-dominated National Unity Front in the struggle
between Burmese political factions. This will enhance U
Nu's prospects for retaining control of the government, but

 

 

 

mayv make him dependent on the front's support. 25X1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25X1

Laos: Communist strategy in Laos appears aimed at
keeping the present premier and his cabinet, which includes
two former Pathet Lao leaders, in power rather than demand-
ing a larger cabinet representation for leftist parties. The
Communists would thus hope to allay conservative fears and
prevent the development of conservative unity. This plan
may be succeeding since a number of conservative leaders .
and the French ambassador are already favoring it. 25X1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tunisia: The Tunisian foreign secretary has informed
the American chargé d'affaires that the government feared
French troops might attempt to join forces with those in Al-
geria, in which case Tunisia would resist the move and hope
for American support. 25X1

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

Bloc economic integration: Moscow's dissatisfaction
with the present status of economic specialization among
bloc countries is reflected in the 24 May communiqué of
the bloc's Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CEMA).
Because of mutual rivalry and unwillingness to depend on
imports from other satellites--highly unreliable in the

' past--the satellites have been reluctant to go along with

o

 

 

 

 

various economic specialization schemes purporting to
aim at a rational division of labor within the bloc. The

e Soviet Union can be expected to exert pressure to enforce

CE ecisions, which have often been ignored in the
25X1 | past.

 

 

 Soviet leadership: Soviet party secretary and presid-
ium member Suslov, who has not been identified in public
since 16 May, may be in trouble. Polish Communists,
noting his absence from the meetings of Communist bloc

and Czechoslovakia participate if Britain and France do.
The letter also suggests .the inclusion of India . and pos-

maintain pressure on the West for a rapid halt in testing

DAILY BRIEF

 

I, THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

 

East Germany: Public demonstrations may occur in
East Germany when the people learn the regime has with-
% drawn its recognition of the German Evangelical Church,
the only remaining all-German organization. Popular dis-
content has already been exacerbated by a tightening of
border controls, a rise in food prices, and an expectation
of additional travel restrictions. Pankow may attempt to
set up a regime-dominated church organization for East

Germany. 25X1

DAILY BRIEF

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Czechoslovakia: Prague officials are said to be dis-
atisfied with the recent CEMA conference decisions, which
pparently require the Czechs to reduce consumer goods
roduction and thereby lower their relatively high standard
f living. Party First Secretary Novotny may seek a reap-
praisal of Czechoslovakia's role in the plan to integrate the
bloc economy when he visits Moscow on 2 July. 2

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

* USSR-Lebanon: Soviet propaganda has carefully avoided
}/O commitfing the USSR to any specific course of action. The
USSR, however, is seeking to convey the impression that it
is opposed to Western action in Lebanon by propaganda
charges of Western preparations for military intervention.
In addition, a Soviet member of the UN Secretariat was used
privately to warn a US official that the USSR would imme-

diately send ""volunteers'' to oppose any American interven-
tion.

Yemen: The Imam is planning a 20-day trip to Italy in
the near future for reasons of health. In his absence, the
Y rivals for the succession, Crown Prince Badr and the Imam's
brother, Prince Hassan, are to govern jointly. A struggle
could break out if Hassan makes some move to supplant Badr,
whose pro-Soviet views have incurred the Imam's displeasure.

North Africa: Tunisian, Moroccan, and rebel Algerian
leaders meeting in Tunis last week reaffirmed their common
commitment to the goal of Algerian independence and took
further steps toward the eventual creation of a North African
federation. Establishment of an Algerian government-in-
exile was again deferred. However, the decision to proceed
with the formation of a '""provisional consultative assembly""
for North Africa promises to enhance the status of the FLN
rebel leaders and to associate Morocco and Tunisia more in~
timately with the FLN.

DAILY BRIEF
25X1

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Hungary: In Budapest, the post-Nagy atmosphere is
one of terror. Amid reports of new trials in the offing, the
police have been reinforced and are said to be arresting
persons who talk openly of the affair. The only top official
comment on the execution has come from two Stalinists in
the party and the regime; this suggests that Kadar's faction
may be losing control of the party.

Yugoslavia: Belgrade expects a continuation of the
Sino-Soviet bloc campaign against Yugoslavia that has devel-
oped in recent months. The Yugoslavs do not discount the
possibility of ""military pressure.' Belgrade has reacted
strongly to the execution of Nagy, and sees his ""murder' as
a ""dreadful warning"" to those who oppose the return of Stal-
inism in the Soviet bloc. The Yugoslavs have called on anti-
Stalinist elements in the Communist world to give ""moral
and political support",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003800040001-5,/meta-64400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

DAILY BRIEF

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

* Poland: The Polish regime apparently has decided to
issue a statement soon, in the party newspaper justifying in
general terms the action against Imre Nagy as necessary to
maintain bloc unity. I the Polish statement fails to denounce
Nagy specifically for his various alleged crimes, Moscow
probably will consider that Gomulka is again temporizing as
he has done on the Yugoslav issue.

 

 

 

 

* Soviet note on Geneva talks: The Soviet aide-memoire
of 25 June represents at the least a major shift in Moscow's
tactics for handling technical test inspection talks at Geneva
and may even indicate a substantial policy change--the aban-
donment of negotiations on inspection and possibly the resump-
tion of Soviet nuclear tests. In sharp contrast with the aide-
memoire of the previous day, the USSR now warns it cannot
attend the Geneva technical talks unless the United States agrees
that the purpose of the experts",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003800060001-3,/meta-63400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

DAILY BRIEF

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

Soviet Seven-Year Plan: The USSR has not made public
a new Seven-year Plan (1959-1965) although the draft was to
have been completed by 1 July. There were earlier indica-
tions that preparation 6f the plan was on schedule, and two
central committee meetings in the past two months have dis-
cussed economic affairs. The US Embassy in Moscow, how-
ever, has received a report than an announcement may be
delayed until September.

 

 

 

 

 

USSR - East Germany: A report that the Soviet Embassy
in East Berlin has been ordered to send Moscow its file on
the problem of the nine American airmen forced down in East
Germany raises the possibility that the USSR may be consider-
ing a new approach to the case. At the same time, the re-
newed denial of Soviet responsibility on 1 July by the USSR's
chargé in Washington suggests that Moscow's purpose in re-
questing the file was to find new arguments to bolster the East
German position. East German officials appear sensitive to
the widespread unfavorable publicity concerning their attempt
to barter the prisoners for enhanced international prestige.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Communist China: Peiping insists that the US cannot
""evade"" the 15-day time limit set by the Chinese Commu-
nists in their note of 30 June demanding resumption of
Sino- American ambassadorial talks. The Chinese have
been careful, however, to avoid outright rejection of Amer-
ican suggestions of willingness to resume the talks at War-
saw.

 

 

 

 

 

 

II. ASIA-AFRICA

Watch Committee conclusion--Middle East: No polit-
ical or military solution to the Lebanese crisis is in sight.

 

 

 

 

Rebel military activity has been op-

 

 

posed by somewhat stronger army actions than previously.
If current political efforts fail to achieve an acceptable solu-
tion and fighting intensifies, Chamoun will probably call for
more extensive UN assistance or may request intervention by
Western or friendly neighboring governments under the provi-
sions of Article 51 of the UN Charter.
There is no evidence of Soviet bloc, UAR, or Israeli inten-

tion to intervene with regular military forces.

. Elsewhere in the Middle East a deliberate initiation of
hostilities is unlikely; however, serious incidents may occur.

The Watch Committee did not issue a separate conclusion
on North Africa.

India: Prime Minister Nehru and his principal deputy in
public statements on 2 and 3 July deplored the execution of
former Hungarian Premier Nagy in the strongest terms they
have yet applied to bloc affairs. Nehru's ""shocked' reaction
reflects the disappointment of his hopes that recent trends
toward liberalization within the bloc would lead to a reduction
of cold war tensions. |

Indonesia: Army chief Nasution's personal spokesman be-
lieves announcement of Dutch plans to reinforce the garrison in
West New :Guinea is aimed at exacerbating US-Indonesian rela-
tions.. Raising the West New Guinea issue at this time, he said,
would force anti-Communist Indonesian elements to join the
Communists in opposing the Dutch move. | |

25X1

 

 

 

 

 

 

Watch Committee conclusion--Indonesia: Soviet bloc aid
to Indonesia continues; however, there are no developments
indicating a Sino-Soviet bloc intention to become directly in-
volved in military operations in Indonesia. The situation con-25x1
tinues to favor local Communist and Sino-Soviet bloc exploita-
tion. |

II1. THE WEST

\

Canada; The cabinet is reviewing its policy of nonrecog-
nition of Communist China. Although an early reversal is not
likely, the Conservative government is under some pressure
. from commercial interests which are increasingly enthusiastic 25X1

about trade prospects with the Chinese Communists.

DAILY BRIEF

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Geneva: When the Geneva talks resumed on 4 July after
a oné-day recess, the Soviet bloc experts dropped, at least
temporarily, their initial insistence that they would refuse to
proceed with technical discussions until the Western delega-
tion made an ""unequivocal"" statement agreeing that the talks
must be directed toward a cessation of nuclear tests. This
shift in tactics probably reflects Moscow's reluctance to risk
an early breakoff on this issue. The bloc delegates' moves
during the third and fourth sessions suggest, however, that
their instructions are to pursue their political aims by more
indirect means designed to create the impression that the
Western experts have agreed on the desirability of a test ces-
sation.

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

New Communist journal: After some delay a new inter-
national Communist journal in 13 languages will begin publica-
tion next month in Prague under a Soviet editor. Its predeces-
sor, the Cominform journal, which ceased publication in the
spring of 1956, was widely considered in Eastern Europe to be
a Soviet vehicle for promulgating Kremlin directives on satel-
lite affairs. The USSR is trying to still objections to the new
journal within the Communist world, particularly in Poland by
stressing that the new publication will be 'only theoretical
and informative.""

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

II. ASIA-AFRICA

there has been firing, as well as explosions of a harassing nature,
in Beirut. The failure of the government security forces to make
a major offensive move apparently reflects army commander

Cyprus: An island-wide general strike has been launched

to protest the death of two Greek Cypriots in an open clash.
with British security forces.

Ceylon: Surface calm prevails in Ceylon under the governor-
generaf;s emergency rule, which has been in effect since 27 May.
Tamil-Singhalese tension remains. The government can be ex-
pected to cope successfully with communal extremists and trouble-:
some labor elements in any local disturbances, but the ability of
the security forces to deal with an uprising on a national scale is
open to question.

 

 

 

 

 

Cambodia - South Vietnam: Bitter recriminations by top
officials in Phnom Penh and Saigon block chances for any early
abatement of the Cambodian - South Vietnamese feud. Govern-
ment-inspired, Communist-exploited demonstrations have al-
ready occurred in Phnom Penh, and Sino-Soviet bloc propaganda
is supporting Cambodia's position.

 

 

 

 

Thailand: Field Marshal Sarit since his return to Bangkok
has faken sieps to stabilize the political situation, but remains
concerned over rumblings of discontent both in the armed forces
and in the unwieldy government coalition party.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

New International Communist Monthly to Begin Publication
In August .

 

The announcement that the new international Communist
monthly, Problems of Peace and Socialism, will begin pub-
lication in late August indicates that some of the problems
which have delayed its establishment, particularly Polish ob-
jections and bloc policy toward the Yugoslavs, no longer pose
a serious obstacle. The periodical, to be published in Prague,
will appear in 13 languages not including Serbo-Croat. Czecho-
slovak and Polish publications have indicated that its chief ed-
itor will be A. M. Rumyantsev, until now chief editor of Mos-
cow's Kommunist.

The establishment of a new vehicle for the ideological
guidance of the world's Communist parties, which was dis-
cussed in satellite party newspapers during 1957, reportedly
received a large measure of agreement during Moscow discus-
sions in November. The decision to establish the journal was

. not announced until March, however. The four-month delay

and the sketchiness of the announcement strongly suggested
that a number of problems remained to be resolved.

In 1947 Gomulka foresaw that Moscow would use the old
Cominform and its publication, For a Lasting Peace, For a
People's Democracy, to limit the satellite governments",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003800160001-2,/meta-65200,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

Thai Cabinet Reshuffle in Progress

A reorganization of Thai Premier Thanom Kittikachorn's
cabinet will probably be completed within the next few days
as an important step in Field Marshal Sarit's program to
stabilize the political situation in Bangkok and to shore up
the position of Thanom, who ranks just below Sarit in the
hierarchy of the ruling military group. '

Sarit's half-brother has already resigned as deputy
minister of industry because of his involvement in recent
scandals in the government sugar and lottery monopolies,
Lt. Gen. Chitti, who ranks high in the ruling clique, is also
expected to leave the cabinet because of involvement in ex-
cessively corrupt practices. The prospective departure of
as many as three other ministers, believed to have strong
leftist inclinations, is also widely rumored. One of the
three is a close friend of Sarit.

Sarit's willingness to force out individuals who have
long been closely associated with him points up his sensi-
tivity to public criticism of corruption in the government
and his concern lest the continued presence of leftists in
the cabinet embarrass him in his steadily improving rela-
tions with the United States. 25X1

Labor and Political Crises in Honduras May Coincide
With Dr. Eisenhower's Visit

 

Political tension is mounting in Honduras, and a crippiing
strike by the 13,000 workers of the United Fruit Company, which
may occur on or shortly after i5 July, could touch off a mil-
itary coup attempt. Dr. Milton Eisenhower is scheduled to ar-
rive in Honduras for a two-day visit on 16 July.

The United Fruit Company, which dominates the economy
of the important north coast area, has refused any major con-
cessions to labor in negotiations for a new labor contract to
replace the one expiring on 15 July. The anti- Communist lead-
ers of the dominant union, which is the virtual keystone of the
entire Honduran labor movement, is fighting a continual battle
with a Communist minority for control of the union and feels it
cannot afford to back down on its wage and other demands. Al-
though both sides have agreed to continue negotiations beyond
the expiration of the contract, an impasse could arise at any
time and result in a strike. '

The government of President Villeda Morales, which was
widely popular when it entered office last December, is fast

losing prestige. | 25X6
25X6

 

 

 

 

 

The fiscal situation has been poorly managed, and

 

the government has not had the funds in recent weeks to pay

salaries to military or civilian officials. A growing number of

army officers are becoming increasingly embittered, and an un-
determined number would use a fruit company strike to justify

a military coup. 25X1

DAILY BRIEF

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

* Soviet political moves: The immediate purpose of
Khrushchev's urgent call for a 22 July summit meeting is
probably to deter any Anglo- American action against Iraq
or the UAR. The note is also probably intended to create
the maximum possible international alarm by references
to a world ""on the brink of catastrophe"" and to Soviet pos-
session of """"ballistic rockets of all types including ICBM's,""
in the hope that this alarm will be translated into heavy:
pressure on the US and Britain to withdraw their forces
from Lebanon and Jordan. Khrushchev",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003800270001-0,/meta-49600,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

DAILY BRIEF

   

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

*USSR--Summit Meeting on Middle East: While Pre-
mier Khrushchev ostensibly agrees to American and British
proposals for a UN Security Council session at the heads-of-
government level, he attempts to construe the Western pro-
,(/é posals as an acceptance of his 19 July call for a five-power

gsummit conference on the Middle East. Khrushchev's aim ap-
parently is to ensure that all the important discussions will
be conducted in a subcommittee of the full council composed -
of the five heads of government--the Big Four and India--plus
representatives of ""interested Arab states.)' The letters are
cast in deliberately ambiguous terms in order to maintain the
maximum freedom of maneuver on such issues as agenda,

 

 

 

 

 

participants, and procedure. 5 5X1
Watch Committee conclusion--Sino-Soviet Bloc (as of %/?
/1/ 0 1600 EDT, 23 July):

A. No Sino-Soviet bloc country intends to initiate hos-
tilities against the continental US or ifs possessions in the
immediate future.

NOTE: It is not believed that the USSR would intentionally re-
sort to general war to expand or preserve its recent gains in
the Middle East. It cannot be assumed, however, that the
Kremlin will avoid all risk of war, and a Soviet miscalculation
of the risks remains a possibility.

B. No Sino-Soviet bloc country intends deliberately to
initiate direct military action against US forces abroad, US
allies, or areas peripheral to the Orbit in the immediate
future. -

NOTE: While the USSR has placed some of its forces in posi-
tions of readiness, the Soviet Union has not taken many of the
measures which would be considered necessary to prepare for
aggressive action in the Middle East or elsewhere.

Soviet military activity in Bulgaria, the Black Sea, and in
V&b the Transcaucasus and Turkestan Military Districts is cer-

tainly intended to intimidate the West and its allies, particularly
Turkey, to back up vigorous Soviet bloc diplomatic, propaganda,
and ""popular' demands for the withdrawal of US and UK forces
from Lebanon and Jordan and to support strong Soviet declara-
tions to restrain Western and Turkish interference with the new
Iraqi regime.

This activity also has the effect of jmprovin the combat
readiness of Soviet forces in the area.

of points in the Middle East, a deliberate initiation of open
hostilities is unlikely in the immediate future.

 

NOTE: The présence of UK troops in Jordan has temporarily
bolstered the weak Jordanian regime.

ly also fedayeen.

Watch Committee conclusion--Indonesia (as of 1600 EDT  95x1

Communist exploitation. Sino-Soviet bloc military involvement
is unlikely.

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

USSR--Middle East summit tactics: Soviet diplomats
have begun to hint that Khrushchev in a summit meeting
at the United Nations will press for the neutralization of

- at least part of the Middle East, backed by great-power
guarantees. As a first step, Khrushchev would call for
the creation of an international commission of neutral
countries, along the lines of the Indochina Control Com-
mission, which would supervise the withdrawal of Amer-
ican and British forces, the holding of early elections in
Lebanon and Jordan, and the cessation of arms shipments
to the area as part of a nonintervention agreement among
the big powers.

 

 

 

 

 

Geneva technical talks: Dr. Fisk, the chairman of
the Western delegation, believes that the Russians want
the Geneva talks to succeed, that they desire an early
agreement on cessation of nuclear tests, and that they
will continue to make concessions to get it. He notes

% that in every important case, the Soviet bloc delegates
have accepted the major elements of the Western position.
Moscow's objective probably continues to be an agreement
in principle to a minimal inspection system in order to
increase pressure on the United States and Britain to
halt tests, but to make it more difficult for them to insist %

Hungary: Kadar's recent actions and his treatment by
other members of the regime and the press suggest that
his position as party chief remains shaky. His opponents
may be trying to effect his removal by convincing Moscow
that he is incapable of effective leadership. His ouster
would probably lead to the elimination of the few vestiges
of leniency in Hungarian internal policy.

can carry out its mission of maintaining internal security.
France has offered some equipment from military stocks in
Tunisia, but Bourguiba says that acceptance would compli-

and his director of security cited a possible crackdown on

 

the Algerian rebels inside Tunisia.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Soviet Diplomats Hint Khrushchev Will Seek Summit
Agreement to Neutralize Middle East

 

 

Recent statements by Soviet diplomats.in Londonand Par-
is suggest that Khrushchev will press for a discussion of the
whole range of Middle East problems at the projected heads-
of-governments meeting at the United Nations. These spokes-
men have hinted that he will urge a great-power guarantee of
the neutralization of at least part of the Middle East and an
agreement on nonintervention which would include an embargo
on arms shipments to the area.

Communist diplomatic sources in London said on 26
July that Khrushchev, as a first step, will call for the
creation of an international commission of neutral nations,
along the lines of the Indochina Control Commission, to
supervise the withdrawal of American and British forces,
early elections in Lebanon and Jordan, and observance of
a great-power nonintervention agreement. The counselor
of the Soviet Embassy in Paris told an American official
on 25 July that he expects the talks to be limited to the Mid-
dle East and hinted that Khrushchev will press for a cessa-
tion of arms shipments to the area, He also said he would
not exclude an attempt to get agreement to the neutraliza-
tion of one or more nations along the lines of Austrian
neutrality.

The Soviet counselor said he was hopeful that the sum-
mit talks in New York would start within the next two weeks.
He expressed surprise that Premier de Gaulle objects to a
conference at the United Nations, but said he expects De
Gaulle will finally agree to attend, especially since France
will be chairman of the Security Council in August. The
Soviet counselor indicated that the ""interested Arab states""
which Khrushchev has insisted should participate include
the UAR, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. He said
they do not include Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Israel,

but hinted that a discussion on this point was possible. He
said he expects President Nasir to attend personally and
the new Iraqi Government to be represented by its United
Nations delegate.

These early hints concerning Khrushchev's line at sum-
mit talks suggest that his basic proposals will closely re-
semble the USSR's call on 11 'February 1957 for a great-
power declaration stating that their policies in the Middle
East will conform to six principles: (1) solution of prob-
lems by peaceful means; (2) noninterference in domestic
affairs of Middle Eastern countries; (3) renunciation of
attempts to involve these countries in military blocs;

(4) liquidation of foreign bases and withdrawal of troops;
(5) mutual ban on arms deliveries; and (6) promotion of
economic development in the area without political or mili-
rv conditions. 25X

Kadar's Opponents May Be Trying to Talk Moscow Into
His Removal '

 

Hungarian party chief Kadar's position continues in
doubt, His opponents in the party, encouraged by the
ideological break with Belgrade and the Nagy execution,
may be trying to effect his removal by convincing Moscow
that Kadar, who has shown reluctance to condemn the
Yugoslavs and who has failed to unify the party or to
stimulate marked gains in economic production, is in- -
capable of effective leadership. His ouster, if effected,
would probably lead to the elimination of the few vestiges
of leniency in Hungarian internal policy.

On his return from the East German party congress,
where he probably conferred with Khrushchev, Kadar was
not met by any prominent regime leaders, and no official
reports by him to the party or government guiding bodies--
normal occurrences in such a situation--have been reported
in the press. His only appearance since that time was at
the Polish National Day reception on 22 July.

Kadar's slowness in following the Soviet lead in the
campaign against Yugoslavia, which was again apparent
from the treatment given his speech to the East German
party congress, probably has annoyed Moscow, and the
long-delayed Hungarian note of 21 July to Yugoslavia,
which again and in detail condemned the Yugoslav role
in the Hungarian revolution, may reflect continued dis-
agreement between Kadar and his opponents on this is-
sue. The very strong condemnation of the Yugoslavs
in this note, connecting Yugoslav officials specifically
with """"treasonous' acts committed by Nagy and his fol-
lowers, was not consistent with Kadar's previous line.
The argumentation in the note was weak, and it included
a perfunctory bow to the bloc line that continued good
state relations with Belgrade are desired. 25X1

Tunisia Requests New Arms Shipments From the United
States and Britain

President Habib Bourguiba on 23 and 24 July requested
Britain and the United States to supply arms for his small,
ill-equipped army to meet the security threat posed by the
presence of armed Algerian rebels in Tunisia. In a sepa-
rate appeal, Director of Security Driss Guiga on 23 July
told the American ambassador that his police units needed
immediately some 200 automatic rifles and several hundred
submachine guns to dissuade the Algerians from attempting
""something .

 

The US and Britain supplied Tunisia by airlift with
several hundred small arms last November, but denied a
second appeal for arms in May. France has offered Tu-
nisia some of the equipment used by troops which are now
being evacuated from Tunisia. Bourguiba fears acceptance
of French arms would incite comment by the Algerian Na-
tional Liberation Front (FLN)--which has already sharply
attacked him for granting a pipeline concession to a French
firm--that he had made some kind of military peace with
France against the Algerians, and thus would reduce his
ability to influence the FLN.

Bourguiba also is still sensitive to earlier French at-
tempts to maintain a monopoly over Tunisia's arms sources--
a policy which French officials now claim to have abandoned--
and prefers alternate Western sources so that France would
be unable to maintain an inventorv of Tunisia's materiel

25X1 DAILY BRIEF

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

I % *]atest Khrushchev letters: Having failed to force the
United States and Britain to accept Soviet terms for five-
power summit talks, Khrushchev now hopes to use a special
session of the UN General Assembly to denounce American
and British actions in the Middle East before events bring
about a further easing in the crisis atmosphere which
Moscow seeks to maintain. Khrushchev apparently had
hoped to use a five-power heads-of-government meeting
to gain Western recognition of the USSR's claim to a ma-
jor voice in Middle Eastern affairs; this effort appears
to have been temporarily suspended. His letters contain
no indication that he plans to appear before the General
Assembly to present the USSR's case personally.

*Khrushchev letter to Macmillan: Khrushchev's 10 Au-
gust letter to Prime Minister Macmillan reaffirms Moscow's
bid for a summit meeting on global issues. Most of the letter
is devoted to rationalizing the USSR's sudden switch to a spe-

\\ cial session of the UN General Assembly. Khrushchev seeks
to reinforce Soviet charges of Western '""maneuvering"" to pre-
_____vent early resolution of the Middle East crisis.

/ USSR-Hungary: Khrushchev's statement to Adlai Steven-

son on 5 August that he had ""decided to spend his vacation ,
with Kadar'"" may indicate that Khrushchev continues to feel @/
that he must intervene personally to support Kadar in his

dealings with the Hungarian party and people. It is not clear

from Khrushchev's remarks whether he is going to Hungary.

Earlier he told the American ambassador he would be vaca-

tioning in Kiev from 16 to 20 August and would spend the re- o
mainder of his holiday in the Crimea. 25X1

Communist China - UAR: Nasir recently told a Japanese ,
Diet member that Chou En-lai will arrive in Cairo ""in several \
weeks.""! Such a visit would afford Communist China an oppor-
tunity to underscore its own interests in the Middle East and
support Peiping's pretensions to a ""great-power' voice on ma-
jor international issues. 2

 

 

 

 

 

Watch Committee conclusion--8ino-Soviet bloc:

A. No Sino-Soviet bloc country intends to initiate hos-
tilities against the continental US or its possessions in the
immediate future.

B. No Sino-Soviet bloc country intends deliberately to
initiate direct military action against US forces abroad, US
allies, or areas peripheral to the orbit in the immediate future.

NOTE: Soviet forces in areas adjacent to the Middle East
appear to have ended their limited alert and have returned
to normal dispositions. Chinese Communist forces do not
appear to intend major action against the offshore islands

 

or Taiwan in the immediate future, although air clashes 25X1
involving numbers of aircraft in the Taiwan Strait area are
robable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

I11. ASIA-AFRICA
Watch Committee conclusion--Middle East:

Although a deliberate initiation of open hostilities in
the Middle East is unlikely in the immediate future, the situation
remains highly unstable throughout the area, particularly where
US and UK interests or commitments are involved, and incidents
and coups could occur at any time.

Jordan: King Husayn has stated he will reject any plan
to use a UN force to assist Jordan to maintain its independ- %
ence. Although he would welcome a UN ""guarantee"" of Jor-
dan's frontiers, his government will continue in practice to 25X1
rely on American and British support. Husayn and Prime
Minister Rifai evidently suspect that the Western powers may
be tempted to sacrlflce their posmon in Jordan in order_to

h ider acreement on Middle Eastern problems

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Soviet suggestion on Jordan: Gromyko put forth a
suggestion in conversation with Secretary Dulles on 12
August that the US and the USSR might agree on some
kind of ""joint statement or decision"" in order to provide
""full assurance"" for the political independence and terri-
torial integrity of Lebanon and Jordan, thus creating a
basis for the withdrawal of Western forces. During the
conversation Gromyko also stated that the Jordanians
should manage their own internal affairs.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

International Communism: Moscow is creating new
machinery to aid in unifying the ideological line of all
. Communist parties. An international commission to deal
"" with ""revisionism"" is said to have been set up under B. N.
Ponomarev, the leading Soviet theoretician who accom-
panied Khrushchev on his recent visit to Peiping, French
Communist leader Jacques Duclos will be second in com-

 

 

mand. In addition, the Soviet party central committee has 25X1

decided to coordinate important decisions relating to inter- .
national Communism with selected non-Soviet Communist i
leaders, apparently to prevent in the future ill effects 25X1 /////f/",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A003900110001-6,/meta-65200,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

DAILY BRIEF

 

 

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Yugoslavia-Albania: Albania may be preparing to break

diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia. This would make it the
first bloc state to go this far in the dispute with Tito. On
15 August Belgrade rejected an Albanian note in which the

7/0 Tirana regime protested the alleged ""assassination"" of an
Albanian national and warned that Yugoslav failure to accept
responsibility for the act would lead to the conclusion that
the lives of Albanian diplomatic personnel in Belgrade ""are 25X1
in jeopardy."" In 1948, Albania was the only bloc country to
break relations with Yugoslavia.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I1. ASIA-AFRICA

UAR - Saudi Arabia; Further moves toward re-estab-
lishing friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and the UAR
can be expected to result from the visit of Saudi Crown Prince

W Faysal,who arrived in Cairo on 15 August.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iran: The arrest of at least two military and several
civilian figures on questionable evidence, following the dis-
tribution of subversive literature by an alleged ""Military
Committee of Iranian Nationalism'' indicates the government's

, continuing fears for its stability. The resultant rumor cam-
M paign will adversely affect the morale of the officer corps.

Cyprus: Britain's announcement on 15 August that it
. intends to begin carrying out a modified version of its
/;,,,U Cyprus plan indicates London intends to go ahead in the
face of warnings about adverse effects among the Greek Cyp-

 

riots and on the Greek Government,

 

 

 

 

 

 

South Vietnam: Vietnamese Communists and other dis-
sidents appear to have embarked on a campaign of economic

b sabotage aimed at weakening the Diem regime. Attacks on two
large French-owned rubber estates have already cut produc-

 

tion of this major revenue-producing commodity.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

III. THE WEST

II., ASIA-AFRICA

 

Jordan: King Husayn considers the UN resolution on the
Middle East a victory for Nasir since he believes it handed
the problems of Jordan and Lebanon back to the Nasir-dominated
Arab League. Husayn indicated to the American chargé on 22
August that unless the United States committed itself to a broad
program of economic, military and financial aid prior to the
expected departure of UN Secretary General Hammarskjold from
Jordan at the end of this week, he would accept the resignation
of the pro-Western Rifai government effective 15 September and
ask within a week or ten days that British troops be withdrawn
by 1 Qctober.

Developments in Jordan

 

King Husayn of Jordan told the American Embassy on 22
August that he considered the recent UN resolution on the
Near East a victory for Nasir since it handed the problems
of Jordan and Lebanon back to the Nasir-dominated Arab
League. Earlier the same day Prime Minister Rifai said
that effective implementation of the resolution would depend
largely on UAR good faith, and that he felt Nasir would con-
tinue to pursue a policy of subversion.

Rifai concluded that the United States' unwillingness to
meet Jordan's request for a mutual defense pact and extensive
military and economic aid made it necessary to change Jordan's
government and bring its foreign policy into line with its Arab
neighbors. He also concluded that the British had decided to
sacrifice King Husayn in order to permit Jordan to reach ac-

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

 

Special Watch Committee Report on Taiwan Strait
Situation:

 

The Chinese Communists probably do not intend to
initiate major offensive military action against Taiwan and
the Penghus (Pescadores) in the immediate future, although

\\O they now possess a capability for major air attacks.

The Chinese Communists have increased propaganda
 attacks and psychological warfare on the Nationalists and
specifically began warning on 27 August that an invasion of
the Chinmens (Quemoys) is imminent.

 
  

25X1 ApproVed or Release : 3900250001-1

 
 
  

.

N

 
x0c- Approved goy-Rele

 
 

The Communists have increased their capabilities to
bring heavy pressure on the Chinmens, the Matsus and
smaller offshore islands and could launch major attacks
against them; with the possible exception of Big and Little
Chinmen, such attack could be made without further mil-
itary build-up and with little or no warning. The ground
and logistic forces have been increased near Amoy but the
assembly of amphibious 1ift necessary for the invasion of
Big and Little Chinmen has not yet been observed.

The Communists are likely to continue heavy artillery

barrages, increase interdiction of supply lines to the is-

lands using artillery, naval, and air elements as necessary,

maintain a high state of readiness for air operations, and

seize one or more of the smaller offshore islands. It is

possible that they will attempt the seizure of one or more

of the larger offshore islands.

25X1

25X1 Incidents between US forces and Chinese Communist

forces are possible.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

USSR: observers have sighted a new
), large delta-wing aircraft on Moscow/Fili airfield. The air-
- \ L craft was about two thirds the size of the BISON jet heavy
U bomber.,

 

 

 

 

 

I1. ASIA-AFRICA

Jordan: Prime Minister Rifai has agreed that present

American aid offers are sufficient for him to withdraw his

threat to resign. He has also agreed to consult the United
. States before asking British troops to withdraw. Popular op-
\\"" position to the pro-Western regime continues. Withdrawal
\ of British troops still seems almost certain to be followed bv
a change of government if not an attempt at revolution.

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

 

 

 

.Communist China: Peiping's official declaration that its
territorial waters extend 12 miles from a base line drawn to
include all coastal islands apparently is intended to formalize
a claim to such a territorial limit. The declaration indirectly
warns the US against escort activities on behalf of the Chinese
Nationalists, stating that ''no airplane or military vessel of
-~ any foreign country' shall enter China's territorial waters or
skies without Peiping's permission. Taiwan and the Penghus
--which ""will some day be restored''--are included in Peiping's
claims, as are the South China Sea islands, but the warning
is not explicitly extended to these areas,

| Watch Committee conclusion -- Taiwan Strait:

The Chinese Communists will continue heavy artillery
barrages, interdict supply lines to the offshore islands by
using artillery and naval elements as necessary, and main-
tain a high state of readiness for air operations.

The Chinese Communists now possess a capability to
launch major attacks against the Kinmens, the Matsus, and
smaller offshore islands with little or no warning. = Seizure
of one or more of the offshore islands is possible, but am-
phibious lift necessary for an invasion of Kinmen and Ieih
Hsu (Little Quemoy) and Matsu has not yet been observed.
The Chinese Communists probably do not intend to initiate
major offensive military action against Taiwan and the
Penghus (Pescadores), but possess a capability for major
air attacks against them.

The Chinese Nationalists, fearing US concessions in
talks with the Chinese Communists, might undertake

commitment, however, would probably be honored only in

India's Attitude on UN Membership for Peiping

 

New Delhi intends to raise the issue of Chinese Commu-
nist membership in the United Nations when the General As-
sembly meets on 16 September, even though it foresees another
defeat. It has sponsored this cause for the past two years and
requested inscription of the item on the UNGA agenda last July,
before the Chinese forces began shelling the offshore islands on
23 August. India presumably feels it cannot now abandon this
stand, especially since it does not believe that Communist
forces actually intend to invade the islands.

Nehru on 15 September once more outlined to parliament
his long-held view that Taiwan and the offshore islands should
become part of Communist China. His government is apparently
embarrassed, however, over the fact that the Communists con-
tinue to shell Nationalist positions almost daily, while the National-
ists take no strenuous retaliatory action. The Indian UN delega-
tion has been instructed to raise the membership issue only rou-
tinely 25X1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New Delhi apparently has no plans for a diplomatic initiative seek~
ing settlement of the Taiwan issue.

India's cautious attitude seems to stem in large part from
a recent reappraisal of the long-range capabilities and inten-
tions of the Sino-Soviet bloc. Nehru, particularly, now seems
to doubt whether the Communist system can survive without the
suppression of individual freedoms--an approach he himself
cannot accept. He is also concerned over Chinese activities
along India's Himalayan frontier and plans to visit Bhutan later
this month.

 The first secretary of the Soviet Embassy in New Delhi
recently expressed anxiety over the ""hardening' of India's at-
titude toward Communist China. 28%X1

USSR~Berlin: In his 2 December talk with Senator Hum-
phrey, Rhrushchev described the Berlin situation as ""a bone
in his throat' which ""had to be settled--he was not going to
back down."" If the West rejected his proposal for a free de-
{/ militarized city, he would carry out his previously announced
\ plan to transfer control of allied access to the East Germans. ",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A004200030001-1,/meta-64400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1958

' 1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

Soviet budget: The summary of the Soviet 1959 budget,
as publicized by the USSR, calls for a sharp rise in revenues
. and expenditures--about 12 percent over last year as com-
pared with an average increase of 4 percent annually in the
previous years since 1953. Over two thirds of this total in-
crease will go toward financing the national economy, pri-
/< marily into investment for further rapid industrial expansion
as the new Seven-Year Plan gets under way. Explicit defense
spending of 96.1 billion rubles maintains such spending at the
level of the last 3 years. However, unstated defense expend-

05X 1 itures included in other budget categories may have increased.

Berlin: The flow of East German refugees into West
Berlin has reached the lowest weekly rate, with one excep-
tion,since 1949. Although refugee figures normally decline
during the holiday season, American officials in Berlin attri-
\ ( 4 bute the present sharp drop in part to more effective East
G German controls over the approaches to East Berlin and un-
certainty among potential refugees, many of whom would
5X1 normally remain in West Berlin, over the future status of
the city.

next April in order to run the government from behind the
scenes. King Husayn, however, may be planning changes
earlier and is considering naming one or two 'liberal"" poli-

view of what he considers his country's basically untenable posi-
tion as an island of Western influence surrounded by hostile gov-
ernments.

II. ASIA-AFRICA

New Afghan-Soviet Military Assistance Agreement May

 

Be Concluded

Afghan-Foreign Minister Naim, who left on 29 Decem-
ber for Moscow, apparently intends to conclude anew agree~
ment to expand the Soviet military assistance program in
Afghanistan, The Afghan Government may regard such a
move as a calculated risk necessary to strengthen its posi-
tion against what it regards as an increasingly unfavorable
Western attitude toward Afghanistan,

Afghanistan has been slow in training its troops to use
Soviet weapons which have already been delivered. Any new
military assistance agreement will therefore probably include
an expanded training program, involving the use of additional
Soviet military instructors. It would also provide for addition-
al Soviet weapons, including heavy arms and more modern air-
craft,

The new agreement for a reported| lwould prob- 25X1
ably be financed by a long-term Soviet Ioan, ending the year-
old Afghan policy of refusing to accept further loans in favor of

 

grant aid. Because of discount prices, Afghanistan has apparent- 25X1
ly received bloc arms worth 'about|_i| under the 25X1
|Soviet arms-assistance agreement signed in 1956 and the 25X1

 

|Czech arms agreement of 1954.

Kabul has expressed strong concern over what it considers
the deterioration of relations with Pakistan since the new mili-
tary regime was established there on 7 October. The Afghan
royal family apparently feels it now must deal with a tougher

Bulganin--are slated for expulsion from the party, but not
for imprisonment or execution. Khrushchev's attack at the
December plenum of the party central committee appeared

 

 

 

to foreshadow some further move against them. The 21st
party congress later this month would provide a convenient
orum before . which f ake the announcement

 

 

 

 

 

Berlin Situation: In a communication of 27 December,
the Soviet commandant in Berlin indicated that the East Ger-
mans now are responsible for cases of US military personnel
detained in East Berlin. This is a hint thatthe USSR already may
have relinquished-to the East Germans an element of its quadri-
partite responsibilities in the city.

Iran: [The Shah of Iran is considering a plan to pur-~ 25X1
chase a 25-percent interest in the consortium of Western
oil companies which operates the country' petroleum in-

dustry. He prefers this to a change in the 50/50 profit-
sharing formula. Apparently seeking US Government Sup-

\QO portfof his plan, the Shah noted that increased oil reve~
nues would decrease Iran's need for American assistance.)

DAILY BRIEF

 

 

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

Geneva talks: @ikoyan, speaking with Secretary
Dullés on 5 January, questioned the desire of the United
States to reach agreement on nuclear test cessation and
warned that such agreement would be impossible if the
United States continued to insist on majority voting in the
proposed control commission,] The nuclear test talks re-
convened in Geneva on 5 January with a gloomy forecast
by the Soviet delegate in view of the West's refusal to ac-
cept Soviet demands for a permanent and unconditional
agreement, Soviet propaganda has charged that the intro-
duction by the US of new information on the difficulties of
detecting underground nuclear explosions is a further move
to prevent agreement.

Surprise-attack talks: The Soviet proposal to reconvene
the technical talks in Geneva on measures to prevent sur-
prise attack reaffirms Moscow's 28 November omnibus plan
which links this problem to disarmament measures. Moscow
probably believes this action will make a favorable public
contrast to Western insistence that the results of the pre-
vious sessions be evaluated before setting a specific date for
reconvening, | |

Iraq: Prime Minister Qasim's order of 14 January, as
written, denies the Communist-dominated Popular Resistance
Force any security functions except in wartime or in an of-
ficially declared state of emergency, when it would operate
under army control. The order may be the result of army
pressure. The local Communist press has not printed the
order,

Laos: India, as chairman of the International Control Com-
mission (ICC) for the Indochinese states, has taken a step toward
reactivating the ICC in Laos, It apparently plans to convene a
""Laos committee' in Saigon in response to Communist charges
, - of American and Laotian violations of the 1954 Geneva Accords.
lL Prior to its adjournment in July 1958, the ICC in Laos limited
0 the government's freedom of action and was often ineffective in
1 checking Communist violations of the Geneva Accords.

*Iran-USSR: Top Iranian officials are reassessing Iranian-

- American relations and what they believe to be US policy toward
the Baghdad Pact area. Ambassador Wailes in Tehran feels
there is a real question in Iranian minds regarding US policy
toward Iran. The concern voiced by these officials over the ex-

0 tent of American economic support is greater than in past years
N and may be due in part to the steady Soviet pressure campaign
against Iran, the latest move of which is a 16 January note call-
ing the proposed US-Iranian defense agreement a ''rather dan--
gerous'"" step.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

*Bulgaria: [T_here appear to have been strong differences
within the Bulgarian party central committee atits December
meeting over plans for the reorganization of the economy,
particularly with regard to the form of agricultural collec-
tives. Party First Secretary Zhivkov reportedly wanted to
continue the gradual merger of collective farms while the
party's former Stalinist boss, Chervenkov, possibly in an
effort to unseat Zhivkov, vigorously proposed the creation
of Chinese-type communes. Decisions of a 16-17 January

central committee plenum suggest that the Zhivkov policies
have won out at least for no@

DAILY BRIEF

 

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Communist China: Chou En-lai, third-ranking member
of the Chinese Communist party, is leading Peiping's dele-
gation to the Soviet 21st Party Congress, although delegations
from other bloc countries are being headed by their party first
secretaries. Mao Tse-tung has never attended a Soviet party
congress and the Chinese appear to have been rotating their
representation at such functions among the leaders ranking im-
mediately under Mao. Therefore, the failure of Mao to attend
this congress does not in itself seem significant. It is possible
that while in Moscow Chou may, as premier, participate in
some phase of the negotiations on the 1959 Sino-Soviet trade
pact, which has been under discussion for several months. -

DAILY BRIEF

 

 

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR: Ambassador Thompson underlines the importance
of Mikoyan's thesis in his speech to the party congress that
the improved atmosphere in Soviet-American relations stems
from awareness of American leaders and public that the bal-

O ' 4 ance of power is shifting to the Soviet bloc. Mikoyan suggests
that the United States is becoming reconciled to the status quo,

especially in Eastern Europe, and that the US may seek to
avoid a showdown on Berlin, 2

 

 

 

USSR-Berlin: Soviet detention of a US truck convoy from
Berlin at the checkpoint on the East - West German frontier
is the first incident involving Soviet detention of a US military
truck convoy since 14 November when one was held near Ber-
lin. At that time, US officials in Berlin believed it was a
deliberate probe of US reactions. The present incident also
Ié appears to be premeditated. It was probably designed to point
O up the vulnerability of Western access as Secretary Dulles be-
gins talks with Western allies on the Berlin and German issues.
The USSR has been planting contradictory statements through
diplomatic and press channels in an effort to confuse the West
concerning the time and circumstances under which access con-
trols will be turned over to the East Germans, 2
(Page 3)

 

 

 

 

 

Yugoslavia:[ Tito's unprecedented statement to Ceylonese 25X1
officials that ""only American power prevents world domination
\_lo by Moscow' may have been in reaction to increasingly aggres-

 

sive bloc policies. He displayed considerable apprehension
regarding Peiping's efforts among the uncommitted Asian na-
tions and warned them against too close relations with Moscow:}

USSR - Communist China: Premiers Khrushchev and Chou
En-lai on 7 February signed an agreement under which the
Soviet Union will supply China with 78 heavy industrial enter-
prises worth five billion rubles ($1.25 billion at the official
rate), according to a press report. The Chinese will pay for

ing for at least 156 ""aid' projects the Soviet Union is already
helping them build. Although considerations of military aid
and political support are cause enough for the recent Chinese
backdown on ideological claims, Moscow may have used the
economic-assistance issue as another lever to hasten Peiping's
retreat.

Yugoslavia-USSR: Tito's recent extension of his impend-
ing visit to the UAR later this month and the inclusion of Greece
in his itinerary will probably cause a further intensification of
his current dispute with the bloc. He probably will be in Damas-
cus on 21 February for the celebration of the first anniversary
of the founding of the UAR. A display of unity between Tito and
Nasir on this occasion will strengthen Moscow's belief that Tito
is promoting current differences between Cairo and Moscow.
The USSR also is likely to be concerned about possible discus-

sions during the Yugoslav le 's visit to Athens on ways to
strengthen the Balkan Pact.

USSR-India: Ehe previously postponed visit of Soviet Pres-
ident Voroshilov to India has been announced by Moscow for late
February. The trip apparently will not include a visit to Nepal
returning King Mahendra's June 1958 visit to the USSR, despite
reported recent Soviet pressure on the Nepal Government for
such a visit. While the Soviet head of state's visit to India will
be largely for ceremonial purposes, the USSR will probably at-
tempt to use the visit to reap propaganda gains from Soviet aid
programs such as the Bhilai steel plant, which was formally
opened on 4 February.J

Austria: A concerted effort by official and nonofficial

Austrian elements to persuade the cabinet to ban the Commu-
nist-front World Yquth Festival scheduled for Vienna in late
July has apparently failed, Since there is strong public oppo-

O K sition to the festival and since it is being actively boycotted by
all non-Communist youth groups, there is a growing possibility
of extensive disturbances during the festival.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR Preparing Record for Possible Breakoff at Geneva

The Soviet Foreign Ministry statement on 8 February de-
manding an unequivocal Anglo-American response to Moscow's
insistence on a permanent unconditional test-cessation agree-
ment, in combination with recent Soviet moves at Geneva, sug-
~ gets that Moscow is preparing the record in anticipation of an
early breakoff of negotiations. The statement's detailed criti-
cisms of the Western position on the key issues of duration of the
treaty and voting procedures in the control commission were de-
signed to present the USSR's stand in the most favorable light.

On 6 February chief Soviet delegate Tsarapkin said the con-
ference was deadlocked and warned thatthe delegates may part
""in a few days' without being able to submit a report to their
governments because the Western powers have failed to present
their full position. Tsarapkin criticized the ""piecemeal' methods

DAILY BRIEF

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

%

G

Berlin: Communist statements on Berlin continue to
point to 27 May as the time when access controls will be
turned over to the East Germans, despite high-level Soviet
suggestions of postponement if negotiations were then under
way. Most recently, the Soviet chief warden at Spandau
Prison told his American counterpart that the USSR was plan-
ning to hand over its prison functions to the East German
Government on 27 May, and an East German newspaper ar-
ticle extolling the glowing prospects for a Berlin without
Americans pointed to this date as the time when the Western
garrisons would leave.

Soviet bloc - UAR: Each of the European satellites, with
the exception of Albania, apparently will participate as a sub-
contractor on specific projects in the construction of the first
25X1 0 /< stage of the Aswan Dam. The satellites also are being awarded
subcontracts for projects under the Soviet economic aid pro-

gram in both the Egyptian and Syrian regions of the UAR.

Laos:ZLaos is under strong pressure from Britain and
France to retreat from its 11 February statement that it is no
longer bound by the 1954 Geneva accords. Vientiane is draft-
: ing a statement that it does not intend either to embark on an
T)O aggressive military policy or to repress domestic Communists.
Laos apparently intends to maintain its previously assumed po-
sition regarding the Geneva accords, however,)

talks or in an exchange of notes, that the West has rebuffed
Soviet efforts to settle these two issues. He probably be-
lieves these tactics will strengthen the USSR's justification
for signing a separate peace treatv and transferring access
controls to the East Germans.) 55%1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

USSR - Communist China: A Sino-Soviet trade agree-
ment was signed in Moscow on 26 February. The agreement
provides for larger Soviet shipments of industrial equipment
to support China's ambitious program for economic develop-
ment, but Peiping, as was the case last year, will probably
export more to the USSR than it receives in order to continue
repayments for loans received prior to 1956. Total trade
between the two countries is planned to reach $1.8 billion
this vear. a 20-percent increase over 1958.

Rhodesia-Nyasaland: The African nationalist threat to

DAILY BRIEF

 

 

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

USSR - East Germany: Khrushchev's visit to Berlin and -
Leipzig this week will probably feature discussions on a sep-
arate Soviet-East German peace treaty. Moscow would hope
to use such discussions to increase pressure on the West for
summit talks on a treaty with both German states. The Soviet
press attaché in East Berlin, |

| |has stated that a separate treafy would be
negotiated but not signed during Khrushchev's visit.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

USSR: A Soviet Foreign Ministry official denied to the
AmeTican chargé on 28 February that the trawler operating
near Newfoundland was engaged in any actions which could have
damaged the trans-Atlantic cables. He charged that there was,
therefore, no basis for the US action in searching the trawler
and that the United States had staged the trawler incident as a
pretext for a hostile press campaign against the USSR. Moscow
Radio has denounced the search party boarding as a ""premed-
itated act of provocation' designed to intensify the cold war and
worsen Soviet-American relations.

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

*USSR-Gosplan: I. I. Kuzmin has been removed from the
USSR's top planning post (Gosplan) apparently in some dis-
favor. However, his assignment to the new State Science
and Economic Council indicates that his technical experience
is still valued. A. N. Kosygin, a candidate member of the
party presidium, was chosen to succeed Kuzmin as chief of
Gosplan, probably because of his prior experience there. Be-
fore his assignment as USSR deputy premier in July 1957,
Kosygin had been Kuzmin's first deputy. The change does
not appear to reflect on the Seven-Year Plan, approved by

R

 

 

X1 the party congress in February, nor does it presage any
change in basic economic priorities,
25X1

 

 

 

 

 

USSR - East Germany: (A Soviet military train, prob- 2
ably carrying missiles and associated equipment, was ob-
served southeast of Berlin on 18 March. A similar observa-

 

 

tion was made last October. Numerous unconfirmed reports/
have indicated the presence of tactical missiles in East Ger-~
many. An increasing number of missile mock-up sightings 2
indicates that missile training of some kind is being conducted

in Soviet units in Kast Germanv.]

lgmana: T First gecretary Gomulka has emerged irom the
party congress as undisputed master of the Polish Communist

party. Not only has Gomulka created a party leadership of

e

his own loyal supporters and eliminated opponents from im-
fportant positions, but he has also succeeded in having the
congress annul the charges he himself had accepted in Septem-~
ber 1948branding him and his adherents as ''right-wing na-
tionalist deviationists.' Congress actions also reflected
Gomulka's determination to follow a moderate course in do-
mistic matters while supporting the USSR on foreign policy.

Berlin: [ The sudden increase in the number of East Ger-
man refugees arriving in West Berlin--5,485 during the last -
two weeks--may reflect popular alarm at indications that the
regime intends more vigorous enforcement of its hard-line 25X1

 

policies. An upsurge in the number of refugees is normal dur-
ing the Easter period, but the total for the holiday perfod this

 

 

 

-\l\ year is higher than in 1957 and 1958. The number of refugees
§' was the largest in one fortnight since September 1958, when
approximately 6,400 entered West Berli?}
[ During March, 204 physicians fled*to West Berlin, an,
indication that East Germany's efforts to win over professional
men by political concessions are still ineffective]

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR-Albania: Khrushchev plans to pay his first visit to
Albania from 25 May to 6 June. The timing of the visit to
coincide with the original Soviet 27 May deadline on Berlin
suggests that he wishes to play down the importance of the
deadline and reassure the West that no unilateral Soviet ac-
tion will be taken during East-West negotiations. While in
Albania,Khrushchev may further define the bloc's attitude
toward Yugoslavia.

 

 

 

 

Watch Committee conclusion--Berlin: No significant
indications bearing on the possibility of hostilities.

 

 

 

 

25X1

 

 

 

 

USSR-KGB: For the second time in two years, the Soviet

- state security apparatus (KGB) has taken a public oath of fealty

to Khrushchev and the party. This pledge, an outgrowth of the
recent state security conference in Moscow, was probably
prompted by continuing party distrust of secret police activ-
ities, Its language also suggests that the regime has ordered
the KGB to step up its counterintelligence activities,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rumania-Israel: @ewish emigration from Rumania to
Israel will resume shoTtly, at least on a reduced scale. The
Rumanian Foreign Ministry has asked the Israeli Legation
to revalidate ""some 130 Jewish emigré documents' which
were issued before emigration was suspended at the end of
February. A strong Arab reaction can again be expected.}

- Iraq: With the 14 July parade still a month away, the
arrival of contingents of artillery and armor on the outskirts
of Baghdad will probably further increase Iraqi nationalists'
expectations that Prime Minister Qasim is about to move de-
cisively against the Communists., Several officials, including
the commandant of the Staff College, have recently told Amer-
icans they believe that a crisis is impending. While continu-
ing public Communist attacks on government policies, reports «

of Communist plotting to assassinate him, or widespread vio- 25X1
lence might cause Qasim to feel the need for direct action, his
performance in recent weeks suggests that he would prefer to

move cautiously and quietly to reduce Communist influence,

DAILY BRIEF

25X1 - a
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC |
*East Germany: Bonn's announcement that the West

German presidential election will be held in West Berlin

on 1 July will probably provoke minor harassments and

stepped-up propaganda attacks by the East Germans. They _ 2
T\D will probably not, however, take actions serious enough to

prevent the holding of the assembly in Berlin. |

I1. ASIA-AFRICA

Union of South Africa: The native rioting which broke

out on 18 June in the important seaport of Durban was appar-
ently spontaneous, Its rapid growth reflects the tense racial

- conditions in the urban areas of South Africa. At least 5,000
Africans were involved in the violence and arson. Similar
violent but unrelated outbreaks may occur in other urban areas
of South Africa within the near future as African nationalists
become more organized and opposition to the government's
racial policies grows., The government can be expected to
maintain an uncompromising position.

Iraq: égrime Minister Qasim intends to appoint to his cabinet
in early July four retired generals now serving in important pro- 25X
vincial posts, | | At least three
of the generals are believed to be anti-Communist. Such a move

[ would strengthen Qasim's claim that his government stands above
'D\ political parties and would tend to inhibit any Communist crit- 25
icism, which has so far stopped short of overt propaganda at-
tacks on Iraqi Army leaders

- Nicaragua: President Somoza and H#s brother, who is chief

of the armed forces, are convinced that new rebel attacks are be-

assistance from the Organization of American States, and the

offensive action against the hostile governments, The more
moderate President, however, does not favor such action at
present,

 

 

 

 

LATE ITEM

*USSR-Geneva; Gromyko's consent to a three-week recess
"" in the foreign ministers' talks reflects the Soviet leaders'
awareness that their tactics at Geneva have so far failed to. in-
duce the Western powers to accept a change in the status of
Berlin which would deprive them of existing rights. Moscow
probably calculates that the West will be under increasing pub-
lic pressure to make further concessions and that the confer-
ence will resume under conditions more favorable to the USSR.
Khrushchev, in his Moscow speech on 19 June; again served
notice that he would never agree to any arrangements which
would perpetuate Western occupation rights in West Berlin in-
(D\Z\ definitely. However, he refrained from issuing any threats of
early unilateral action to sign a separate peace treaty and trans-
fer access controls to the East Germans. Khrushchev reaf-
firmed the USSR's desire for a negotiated settlement, termed
the Geneva talks as having ''definite positive value,'"" and ex- 25

L

pressed confidence that the West under pressure of public opin-
ion will eventually agree to a summit meeting.

USSR-Berlin; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin told
the West German ambassador in Moscow that the USSR would
accept a compromise time limit of two years, during which
the Allies could remain in West Berlin and an all-German

Zorin stated that the USSR would not challenge Western rights

 

in West Berlin at the end of this period if agreement had not /////Z
been reached by the Germans., He observed that a separate v

eace treaty with East Germany would be a very serious ste i

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

USSR-Geneva: Khrushchev's renewed call for a summit
meefing in his speech on 28 July, taken with the absence of
any important modifications in Gromyko's positions at Geneva,
suggests that Moscow may agree to terminate the Geneva talks
and then press for an early summit meeting. Gromyko may,
however, make some last-minute adjustments on such prob-

: lems as the link between an interim Berlin arrangement and

O K all- German negotiations. If these do not produce agreement,
he may propose that the foreign ministers prepare a docu-
ment setting forth their differences and agree on a date for a
summit conference. |

25X1 - Cuba: The Castroregime has frustrated an apparently siz-
able conspiracy building up against it. Hundreds have been ar-
rested, chiefly armed forces personnel held over from the
Batista government and large landowners who had actively op-~
posed Castro's agrarian reform law. Allegations that Trujillo

D agents were involved in the plot, and the threat of landings in
) Cuba by a force of Cuban exiles from the Dominican Republic,
l\ probably will be used by Cuba to support its case against the

Dominican Republic at the hemisphere foreign ministers' con-
ference opening in Chile on 12 August,

 

 

 

 

 IV. CONCLUSIONS OF SPECIAL USIB COMMITTEE
ON BERLIN SITUATION

The USIB has taken note of the following conclusions reached
D\(/ by its special committee on the Berlin situation. The committee
' pointed out that its conclusions are to be used in context with all
SNIEs relevant to the Berlin situation.

between President Eisenhower and Khrushchev and further

negotiations which may grow out of these, it is un-
likely that the USSR will conclude a separate peace
treaty with East Germany or turn over access con-
trols to the East Germans., The USSR will from time
to time use threats of such action as a form of pres-
sure on the West. The actual physical transfer of
controls could be accomplished with little or no warn-
ing,

. 2. 'The USSR continues to maintain its hard po-
sition on Berlin as developed at the Geneva foreign
ministers' conference and is unlikely to offer any sig-
nificant new proposals on Berlin pending discussions
between President Eisenhower and Khrushchev.

tions in the even urn rassment, or blockade,

Cuban Officials Still Tense in Wake of Abortive Conspiracy

 

The Cuban armed forces remain alerted and the government
is still nervous even though the large-scale conspiracy against it
has apparently been suppressed. Further attacks are apparently
expected, probably from the armed group led by former Cuban
General Pedraza that has been training in the Dominican Republic
for some months,

 

25X1

 

 

 

[Cuban
authorities have long been alerted to possible landings from the
Dominican Republic. Whether or not they take place, the impli-
cation of Trujillo agents in the conspiracy will strengthen Cuba's
case against the Dominican Republic at the hemisphere foreign
ministers' meeting opening in Chile on 12 August.

The planned revolt of a portion of the armed forces under
William Alexander Morgan was compromised at the last moment
by the defection of one of the plotters, | | 25X1
Morgan 1S an American

 

 

 

cifizen who fought against the Batista dictatorship with a guerrilla
group independent of Castro's 26 of July Movement and later fell

out with Castro. He is reported to have accepted a large sum of
money from Trujillo agents to lead a revolt and to have left Florida
for Cuba on 5 August, His present whereabouts is unknown, but.
press accounts of fighting in Las Villas Province--his stronghold
during the anti-Batista fighting--indicate that he may have attempted
an armed revolt there, There also were unsuccessful attempts to
assassinate Fidel Castro and his brother Raul on 8 and 9 August,

Hundreds of arrests during the past four days included chiefly
armed forces personnel held over from the Batista regime and

large landowners who had actively opposed Castro",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A004600370001-0,/meta-63400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1959

Thailand - North Vietnam: Thai and North Vietnamese Red .
Cross representatives have reached agreement in Rangoon on
the repatriation of some of the 40,000 to 50,000 Vietnamese
refugees in northeast Thailand, Implementation will require
the presence for an extended period of a North Vietnamese Red
\)\ Cross mission in Bangkok., The Thai Government's willingness
Q' to accept such a mission underscores its concern to effect a
solution to the internal security problem posed by the refugees'
presence in the frontier provinces adjoining Laos. Despite
the mission's administrative nature, Hanoi probably will at-
tempt to magnify its importance in accordance with North
Vietnam's policy of increasing contacts with nonbloc nations.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

 

 

Berlin: On 14 August, East German police attempted to
exercise jurisdiction over official Allied use of the autobahn
access route between Helmstedt and Berlin for the first time
in full view of Soviet personnel. An American officer in his
own car was stopped by the East Germans about 60 miles from

9]4 the Babelsberg checkpoint and was held for an hour and 20 min-
utes. Soviet personnel in a vehicle which had been following
the American car and keeping it under surveillance made no
effort to intervene. This incident appears to have been con-

trived to demonstrate that the East German regime is being
permitted to exercise control over Allied access to Berlin in
those areas of East Germany which are outside the immediate
confines of Soviet checkpoints.

South Korea - Japan: South Korean representatives in Tokyo
are negotiating with Japan for a settlement of differences between /
the two countries despite the signing on 13 August of the Japanese -
North Korean agreement for the repatriation, to begin in Novem-  25x1
ber, of Koreans resident in Japan to North Korea. South Korea,

Y however, remains adamantly opposed to the planned repatriation,
and, if dissatisfied with the course of the present negotiations,
may at any time use this issue as an excuse to break them off.

*USSR: Khrushchev, in his trip to attend Peiping's 10th
anniversary celebrations immediately following his visit to
the United States, will seek to allay any Chinese Communist
apprehensions over the effect of his talks in Washington on
Communist China's international objectives, particularly

 

@ Taiwan, Khrushchev may seek to ease points of ideological
M f differences, such as have arisen over the communes, by re-

affirmation of his recent statement that each bloc country
must take into consideration its '""national, cultural, and eco-

nomic peculiarities",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A004700050001-4,/meta-55800,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1959

Reactions to Khrushchev's disarmament proposals: Non-
Communist comment on Khrushchev's disarmament proposals
has been generally cautious. Official comment, while frequently
expressing skepticism, has assured that the proposals will be
carefully studied. Influential West European information media
are stressing the propagandistic nature of the proposals and are
criticial of the absence of provisions for effective control. Nasir
has lauded the proposals as consistent with long-standing desires
of the Arab world, and they have received top billing in Iraq.
Socialist and leftist elements in Japan, the United Kingdom,
Australia, Italy, and elsewhere, urge that fullest consideration
be given the proposals ""as the best hope remaining in the world,
but to this enthusiastic response is sometimes added the hope
that Khrushchev is ready to accept an effective inspection and
control mechanism.

I111. THE WEST
25X1
: France-Algeria: Favorable reaction abroad to De Gaulle's
17 September proposals on Algeria, which were aimed partly at
Free World countries whose support he is seeking for France's
position in the United Nations, are thus far centered largely in
Western Europe. In Latin America, where Paris had particu-
larly hoped to retain support or to win over several countries--
Cuba, Chile, Uruguay,and Venezuela--which have indicated they
would probably vote against France, the impact of the De Gaulle
speech was considerably diminished because of preoccupation with
Khrushchev's visit to the United States. Many important ""neu-
trals' such as India are likely to await the Algerian rebels' reply
to De Gaulle's proposals before taking a stand. The rebel govern-
ment is now meeting in Tupis. Communist bloc reaction has been
generally negative but to date has been expressed primarily in low-
level propaganda commentary. 25X1

 

 

 

 

 

Brazil: The government may send a trade mission to Moscow
this week to negotiate a large-scale barter agreement involving
Soviet petroleum, | |

The amount involved may be as much as $100,000,000, about
< alf of Brazil's annual oil import requirements. The USSR has of-
? } fered Brazil smaller amounts of oil several times in the past year
and during the summer reportedly offered to buy large amounts of
coffee as part of its continuing effort to conclude a trade treaty,
Several high-ranking Brazilian officials are opposed to large-scale
transactions with the USSR, but President Kubitschek may believe
it offers the only politically feasible solution to the country's severe
foreign exchange difficulties.

DAILY BRIEF

 

 

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

 

Communist China - USSR: Peiping's domestic propaganda
continues to reflect a degree of opposition to Moscow's more
moderate approach to the United States. An article in the cur-
' rent issue of the Chinese theoretical journal Red Flag implicitly
criticizes Moscow by attacking """"Chinese bourgeois elements""
O k who had been reluctant to continue ""sharp struggles against US
imperialism"" and by condemning the ""heinous US aggressor' as
a threat that must be destroyed. The article reaffirms Peiping's
determination eventually to ""liberate'"" Taiwan, but it does not
threaten immediate action, 25X1

 

 

 

 

Communist bloc ~ Guinea: Continuing efforts by the Com-
munist bloc to cater to Guinea's desire for international status
and to establish close political and economic ties were reflected
in the speeches and display of friendship by the bloc delegates at
the recent congress of President Sekou Touré's Democratic party--
O Q Guinea's only political party. The absence of Western delegates
enabled the specially invited bloc delegations to further the im- 25X1
pression that achievements by the Touré regime during Guinea's
first year of independence have been largely due to bloc assist-
ance,

Laos:CStrong feelings within the Laotian Government over
French inadequacy in military training and over French efiorts
to play down the seriousness of the current crisis are threat-
ening further to impair relations between the two countries.
The French are reacting strongly to an American newspaper
0 article, based on an unattributed interview with Laotian Pre-

).) mier Phoui, stating that Laos would sever ""major relations""
with France if the Communist threat were contained and US
support continued. While Laos is unlikely to carry out this 25X
threat, the incident will widen the French-Laotian rift, to the

India-USSR: India's second government-owned oil re-
finery is to be built by the USSR under terms of an agreement
concluded in New Delhi on 28 September. Financing to the ex-
tent of $25,000,000 will be provided under the long-term Soviet
credit of $378,000,000 extended in July for the Indian Third
Five-Year Plan (1961-66). India has also requested Soviet
technical assistance in operating the 2,000,000-ton refinery,
to be built at Barauni in Bihar State in east-central India.
Last October New Delhi signed an agreement with Rumania
for construction of a refinery in Assam with a capacitv of
1 annually.

 

 

Japan - North Korea: 2_',Ifokyo has rejected demands by pro-
Communist Koreans in Japan for the elimination of ""objection-
able"" procedures for repatriation to North Korea, especially a
provision to assure that no Korean is sent against his will. A

Communist-inspired boycott of the repatriation program has

 

resulted in the application of fewer than 200 Koreans for repa-

 

 

triation in the first three days of the registration period.
Tokyo's rejection will provide the Communists with an excuse
for blaming the government for the failure of a significant num-
ber of Koreans to anpnlv for repatriation as the Communists

 

 

had predicted.

Laos: The Tunisian member of the UN subcommittee,
Habib Bourguiba, Jr., was recalled from Laos on 29 Septem-

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

Communist China ~ Guinea: Communist China, pressing
to expand its influence in tropical Africa, has obtained its first
formal diplomatic representation in the area with an agreement
to exchange ambassadors with Guinea. The agreement with
Conakry, where the USSR, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia al-

D ready maintain embassies, was signed in Peiping on 4 October
"" by Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Guinea's Minister of Educa-
tion Barry Diawandou. Peiping is likely to cite the agreement
_ with Guinea in its efforts to convince Ghana that it too should
/ exchange formal representation,

outspokenly anti-Communist, have been closed down and the ed-

which Qasim is permitting to exercise virtual control over the

Iraqi press. Communist domination of the association was

achieved in September with the aid of the socialistic National . 25X1
Democratic party,

 

 

 

 

Morocco: [_T_he crown prince is reported to be displeased 25X1
with the size of the initial American arms shipment scheduled
to reach Morocco for display during the mid-November national
holiday. He characterized the proposed shipment as ''ridicu-
lously small and entirely inadquate' for the spactacular demon-

/O stration he wants of American support for the palace and Royal
N Army. This adverse reaction appears to be a gambit to obtain
a larger shipment, Meanwhile, the Moroccans seem to be re- 25X1
sisting French pressure to fill Royal Army requirements for the
November parade, and the USSR and Czechoslovakia are reported

to be offering ""everything and anything' the Moroccan Government
25X1 want/sIJ

e

Indonesia: Rumors of an impending army coup appear to
arise in part from general apprehension over increased army in-
fluence in the government, The Indonesian Communist party may

'D ' be exploiting such rumors in an effort to aggravate President

Sukarno's apparently growing uneasiness over the army's polit-
ical role. '

II. ASIA-AFRICA

L

Laos: @e Japanese and Italian chief delegates on the
UN subcommittee, in separate talks with Premier Phoui 25X 1
prior to their recent departure from Vientiane, expressed
their personal opinions that Laos should make the best of a
bad situation and seek some sort of accommodation with its
Communist neighbors. They suggested presenting to the UN
Security Council a mediation formula designed to achieve this
result. Phoui, upset by their views, which he reported to the

.

 

.

 

 

 

US ambassador, plans to fly to New York near the end of the
month in order to argue the Laotian case personally.] [ |

UAR: [The visit of UAR Vice President Field Marshal Amir
to Syria emphasizes Nasir's continuing concern over the organiza-
tion and reliability of the UAR First (Syrian) Army. Since forma-
tion of the UAR in February 1958, Cairo has tried hard to re- 25X1
move or neutralize Syrian Army elements of questionable loyalty
ND to the concept of union or those involved in any political action.

A reshuffle of First Army personnel, perhaps of major propor-

 

 

 

tions, appears to be under way, and Amir's presence may be

essential to assure that the changes will be effected without - 29X1
dangerous repercussions.)

25X1 Ceylon: @he position of the new government has been seri-

ously jeopardized by the arrest on 14 October of a Buddhist

priest--a high official of the government party--in connection

with the assassination of former Prime Minister Bandaranaike. 25X1
The close association of the priest with several .cabinet - =
ministers will intensify suspicion that top government officials
were involved in a conspiracy. Those politicians implicated may
be.forced to resign from the government and others may defect

rom the ruling party, thus depriving Prime Minister Dahanayake

I1. ASIA-AFRICA

Sino-Indonesian Friction Likely to Increase

 

Friction between Peiping and Djakarta, already relatively
high over the issue of Overseas Chinese, can be expected to in-
crease as the Indonesian Government accelerates and Peiping
seeks to obstruct implementation of two executive orders affect-
ing Chinese in rural areas. One of the orders bans alien retail-
ers in rural areas effective 1 January 1960. The second requires
all Chinese, regardless of occupation, to leave rural areas un-
less they become employees of succeeding retail organizations.

Already several dozen Chinese near Tjibadak, West Java,
are reported to have been beaten for resisting resettlement. Ac-
cording to unconfirmed, and probably exaggerated, information
which reached the US consulate in Surabaya, 200 to 300 Chinese 25X1
were Killed or wounded near Pontianak, Borneo.

 

 

 

 

| Since 2 Novem-

 

 

 

ber, Communist-controlied papers in the colony have featured ar-

ticles critical of Indonesian restrictions on Chinese retailers. The
mainland press has thus far made noc comment, @se of the Hong 25X1
Kong Communist press suggests that Peiping intends to conceal

from other Asian countries the full extent of its pressure on Indo-

nesia and to create the impression that Chinese outside Commu-

nist China are outraged by the persecution of their ""brothers"" in

Indonesia.

Imam's Economy Measures Cause Yemeni Tribal Dissidence

 

25X1

 

 

 

Tribal dissatisfaction appears to be a direct result of the
Imam's recent moves to improve Yemen's serious financial dif-
ficulties. Crown Prince Badr bought tribal allegiance during the
crisis which occurred when the Imam was vacationing last sum-
mer; these payments now are the target of the Imam's economy
measures. In addition, the Imam has canceled Badr's pay increases
to the army, creating another element of potential dissidence, al-
though there is no evidence as yet of military support for any move
against the monarchy.

At least one of the several Cuban military purchasing mis-

*USSR-Indonesia: Khrushchev will make an official visit
to Indonesia in February and is expected to stop briefly in New
Delhi en route. He will probably try at both stops to improve re-
lations between his hosts and Communist China. He will be seek-
ing official expressions of support for major Soviet foreign pol-
icy positions and, to this end, would probably welcome invitations

to visit other South and Southeast Asian countries during this pre-
summit trip.

 

 

 

11. ASIA-AFRICA

Laos: %remier Phoui's anticipated resignation was ac-
cepted by the King on 31 December, Bitter mutual recrimina-
tions attending the resignation will make negotiations difficult

for the creation of a new anti-Communist coalition cabinet in-

cluding both Phoui's followers and members of the young refor
ist group (CDNI). During the present tense atmosphere in Vien-
tiane, the army has moved to occupy key points in the city.] 25X1:

Indonesia-USSR: A Sukarno-Khrushchev ag'reement, ap-

initialed during Khrushchev's recent visit, calls for the USSR
to supply Indonesia with one cruiser and three or four sub- ///5/7

N() marines, according to the Indonesian naval intelligence chief. 55y 54/%?
E:ndonesian Navy officials say they wish to accept from the -
USSR only that support which cannot be obtained from the
United States, Accordingly, the navy will accept only equip-
ment from the USSR, and will look to the United States for

Irag:@'aq plans to ship a total of 825,000 barrels of crude
oil to East Germany and Communist China within a few weeks. 25X1
Under its agreement with the Iraq Petroleum Company, Baghdad
receives a royalty of one eighth of annual oil production either
in cash or crude oil. Until this year Iraqi governments have
) l elected to take cash except for that oil used locally. Iraq's ef-
0 forts to sell its share of this year's estimated output of crude--
nearly 43 million barrels--in Western countries have failed so

far,and only these small sales to the Communist bloc are known
to have been made.] |

 

 

 

 

South Africa: The riots in South Africa's Transvaal Province
on 2I March, which resulted in at least 50 deaths, were stimu-
lated by the campaign of a militant new antiwhite nationalist or-
panization against the restrictive South African identity-card sys-
tem. Peaceful demonstrations by this group, the Pan Africanist
Congress, which has contacts with pan-Africanists in Accra and
elsewhere, are taking place in other parts of the country. The riots
indicate a growing organizational ability among the Union's Africans,

France: De Gaulle's refusal to meet demands for a special %

session of parliament to discuss the government's agricultural %

policy has produced a hostile reaction among the majority of /

deputies and given De Gaulle's rightist opponents new impetus //

for attacks on the government. Left and center parties are con- f/%

Japan: @eliberations in the Diet on the new US-Japanese
security treaty are reaching the decisive stage., Prime Min-
ister Kishi, who is assured of sufficient votes for ratification,
is planning to push for a vote by the lower house between 22
and 26 April. However, the opposition Socialists are insisting
on further time for debate, and this demand has recently won

D}-/\ some influential press support. Informed observers believe
that unless the government delays its plans for ten days to two
weeks, it will risk a Socialist boycott of the Diet and possibly
widespread public furor over what would be considered its dic - 25X1 %

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR: The Soviet trawler Vega, fitted with an unusual
amount of electronic equipment and towing an unidentified
\ object astern, attempted to recover a Polaris test vehicle
\ 25X1 launched by the US submarine George Washington during tests
on 26 April about 120 miles off the coast of New Jersey. The
trawler was forced from the immediate vicinity by the maneu-
vers of a US Navy tug, but remained in the general area through-
out the day. Soviet trawlers have been suspected for some time
of engaging in electronic collection efforts against US missile
programs. The activities of the Vega are the most aggressive
noted to date, and the first tp be related to the Polaris program.

Lib}{, a: On 25 April, for the first time in Libya's eight N
and a half years as an independent state, the Chamber of §\§§:
Deputies passed a motion of censure against the government, R\
While the specific issue was the government's unpopular de- §\§
cision permitting the visit of Italian fleet units in February \\\§
1960, the chamber's action clearly showed the increased :\\
strength of opposition elements following January's parlia- §§
mentary elections. These elements can be expected to exert &

further strong pressure for modification of the American

military base agreement, and King Idriss may soon appoint

a new prime minister and other cabinet officials who will be 25X1
more susceptible to such pressure. | |

officials and Belgian Communists to gain a foothold in the Bel-
gian Congo, which becomes independent on 30 June, pose a

. threat to the Congo's pro-Western inclination. The consul
general in Leopoldville observes that Communist contacts with
the Congolese have increased since the round-table conference 25X1
in Brussels last February, when numerous Congolese dele-
pates took advantage of invitations to visit the bloc.

L\ Communist Bloc - Africa; The USSR's prompt recognition

.of Togo, like that accorded Cameroun in January, underscores
the bloc campaign to cultivate the new African nations. At least
five more countries are scheduled to achieve their independence
\\\\\§ this year. Moscow's efforts will undoubtedly be furthered by
\\\ Khrushchev's planned visit to West Africa this fall, as well as
0'2\ through offers to extend economic aid and dispatch diplomatic
missions. Since 1958, when the USSR broadcast three hours
a week to Black Africa, the bloc's radio propaganda output has
climbed to more than 60 hours per week. |

laos: Conservative candidates continue to pile up leads
of implausible proportions as returns from the National Assembly
elections on 24 April filter in from outlying districts. Negoti-
ations for the new government to be formed after the assembly
convenes on 10 May may be protracted and will probably lead
to néw tension between former Premier Phoui's Rally of the
Lao People and the reformist Committee for Defense of Na-
X 125X1 tional Interests. | |

25X1 DAILY BRIEF

  
  

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

East Germany: A total of 15,502 East Germans fled to
West Berlin in April 1960, compared with less than 9,000 in
March and 9,162 in April 1959. - The proportion of male ref-
ugees of military age was the highest in 20 months. A new
D\i element in the latter half of April consisted of youths fleeing
a regime drive to assign them to collective farms as workers,

 

 

 

 

II. ASIA-AFRICA 251

 

 

Lebanon: Christian-Moslem tension. is increasing as plans
are being made for parliamentary elections. Intervention of Mos-
lem police in a dispute between rival Christian factions en route to
a pontifical mass in Beirut on 1 May resulted in two deaths and

D K\ more than 60 other casualties. Extremist Christian elements have
retaliated by bombing the home of the director of National Police, a

Moslem. President Shihab can be expected to order stringent con-
trols, but further incidents are probable.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

_

. Czechoslovakia: Khrushchev was persuaded by Czecho-

7 7
/////7 /

 

 

 

\\\\ slovak party boss Novotny, during the latter's visit to Moscow
§ from 2 to 4 May, to put in an appearance at the Prague libera-
% tion celebrations which began on 7 May, according to rumors
Q\E again circulating in Czechoslovakia. The Soviet ambassador. in
\% Prague told the French ambassador there was a good possibility
\\§ V\. that Khrushchev would appear in Prague before the summit meet-
% . D ings. The personal attention which Novotny received from the
&\ Soviet leader during his Moscow stay also suggests that reported
% differences between the two countries--including Czech opposi-
§ tion to the policy of detente--have been resolved, and that Khru-
Q% oY1 shcheyv migl;t visit Plrague prior to the summit to demi)nstrate
\ unanimity of views.

\ 11. ASIA-AFRICA

 
 

\§ Turkey: Local security forces reinforced by army units are
maintaining order in Turkish cities, but the political atmosphere
remains tense and new disorders could break out. A majority of
the governing Democratic party's parliamentary deputies is re-~
ported opposed to the further use of ""abnormal' methods to sup-
press the opposition Republican People's party. Premier Menderes,
D&L is believed to be seeking a meeting with opposition leader Ismet
Inonu in an attempt to reduce tension.

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

I1. ASIA-AFRICA

  
  

Japan: The contmumg demonstrations by a small
minority of extremists against Prime Minister Kishi and
the US-Japan security treaty apparently have not, thus far
at least, stimulated large-scale public reaction. Kishi's
power play in forcing lower-house approval of the treaty
has momentarily weakened his position. LHe still remains
the only conservative leader who has the support of a ma-
'fonty of the ruling Liberal-Democratic party, however, and
no logical successor is in sight.J With upper-house approval
of the treaty assured, intensified demands by Kishi's rivals
that he step down could prompt the holding of an election for
rarty president soon after the Diet adjourns in mid-July,

25X1 Cambodia: Prince Sihanouk, in his strongest anti-US
statements in many months, has accused the United States
of following a ""'blind policy"" of tolerating South Vietnamese
and Thai hostility toward Cambodia. At the same time,
Sihanouk has praised Communist China and stated that Com-
munist countries.in contrast to the ""free world's hostile atti-
k_\ tude,have done nothing against Cambodia.!' Further, and

0 possibly stronger, emphasis on this pro-bloc, anti-US theme
seems certain in the period prior to the 5 June referendum
Sihanouk has called to allow the electorate to choose between 25X1
him and his detractors. |

*Morocco: Following his dismissal of the Ibrahim government
on 20 May, the King announced on 23 May that he personally
- would rule for a two-year period and would seek to prepare the

country for a constitutional monarchy. He apparently will ap-
point Crown Prince Moulay Hassan as his deputy premier. This
appointment will almost certainly provoke increasing opposition
among left-wing political and labor groups, which regard the

D\L Prince with growing disfavor. Ibrahim's ouster followed his re-
cently frequent challenging of royal authority in regard to the 3
control of the police, his dismissal of all French technicians in 25X1 |
the national security establishment, and his rejection of a pro-
posed increase in the number of Ameri servic
Morocco.

BeI:%ia,n Congo: Attacks by leftist Congolese leaders Patrice
Lumumba and Anicet Kashamura on Brussels' program leading
to Congolese independence, and their demands for the withdrawal
of Belgium Army reinforcements ordered to the Congo, raise
\L\ some possibility of an African attempt to seize political power in
T) -the northern Congo. Should such action be started, Belgian secu-
rity forces appear sufficient to suppress it.

II. ASIA-AFRICA

Japanese Political Crisis

 

A small leftist minority, consisting primarily of labor union-
ists and radical students, has continued to demonstrate against
Prime Minister Kishi and the US-Japanese security treaty, butex-
cept for strong press condemnation of the government, there has
thus far been no large-scale public reaction. The press, while gen-
erally critical of Kishi for forcing ratification of the treaty in the
lower house of the Diet, assesses the Socialist resort to violence
in the Diet and student attacks on Kishi's official residence as added
blows to parliamentarianism in Japan. One of the nation's three
largest newspapers is demanding Kishi's resignation.

25X1

Kishi, for the moment at least, has been substantially weak-
ened, but says that he will surrender his aspirations for a third
term as Liberal-Democratic party (LDP) president--tantamount to
the prime ministership--only if the entire party is agreed that he
do so. [The LDP policy board chairman has commented that Kishi
is the only conservative leader who has majority support in the party
and that no logical successor is in sight.]

 

 

 

 

Nevertheless, several party factions are calling for Kishi's resig-
nation, and there are indications that, once final treaty ratification
is secured, such pressure may be intensified with the participation
of some party members now supporting Kishi. The extent of public
criticism of Kishi probably will determine the ultimate success of a
move to oust him, and could advance the party presidential elections
from January 1961 to a date soon after the Diet adjourns in mid-July.

Legislative deliberations now focus on the upper house, which
has 30 days in which to act; after this time the treaty is automatically
ratified. The Socialist party seems intent on a complete boycott of
the deliberations, but the moderate Democratic Socialist party (DSP),
which already has been damaged in the early phase of its political
life by vacillation on the treaty issue, remains undecided as to its
next step. The Socialists have announced their strenuous opposition
to a visit by President Eisenhower under present circumstances, and

Cambodian I_..eader Criticizes United States

 

Prince Sihanouk, in recent public statements including
editorials and broadcasts, has accused the United States of
following a ""blind policy"" of tolerating South Vietnamese and
Thai hostility toward Cambodia. Laos now has been added
to his list of ""imperialist' neighbors encircling Cambodia.
At the same time, Sihanouk has praised Communist China
for its understanding attitude toward his neutrality policy,
and has stated that in contrast to the ""free world's hostile
attitude,'"" Communist countries ""have done nothing against
Cambodia.""

In his personal newspaper, The Nationalist, Sihanouk
wrote on 21 May that the West's """"defeats' in the cold war are
attributable to the '""bad faith of imperialist circles, who claim
to be working for the free world.""

Sihanouk's statements against the United States are the
strongest in some time and go against his usual practice of
carefully counterbalancing any significant Communist bloc
propaganda gain in Cambodia, such as that achieved by Chou
En-lai's visit earlier this month, Further, and perhaps
stronger, emphasis on this pro-bloc, anti-US theme seems
likely in the period prior to the 5 June referendum which
Sihanouk has called to permit the Cambodian people to
choose between him and his detractors. Sihanouk is in a
depressed and troubled mood, probably stemming basi-
cally from continued friction between him and the palace
over the succession issue, with the barbs of the dissident
Cambodian radio a contributing factor. The American Em-
bassy in Phnom Penh notes that Sihanouk is especially un-
predictable when in such a mood. | 25X1

Congo Nationalists Split by Extremist Attacks on Belgians

Moves by Belgium to deter further election violence in
the Congo and to reassure European residents there have been
vigorously attacked by extremist Congolese leaders, who may __
hope to create an atmosphere which would permit them to
seize power in the northern provinces. Other African lead-
ers, however, have remained aloof from the extremist attacks.

Criticism of Brussels' program for Congolese independence
by leftist leaders Patrice Lumumba and Anicet Kashamura be-
came virulent on 18 May. In a press conference. they charged
the Belgians with ""rigging' the balloting for a Congo legislature,
demanded that provision be made for new elections within six
months of the Congo's 30 June independence date, and rejected
the colony's projected constitution as having been ""prepared
by Belgium."" Both attacked the dispatch of Belgian Army rein-
forcements to the Congo, where inflammatory oratory by
Lumumba and others had stimulated anti-European demonstra-
tions and had increased apprehension among Europeans.

The sweeping character of the charges by Lumumba and
Kashamura probably contributed to their repudiation by the
four other African members of the General Executive Col-
lege--the interim organization governing the Congo in the peri-
od prior to independence. It is possible that Lumumba and
Kashamura are concerned about their showing in the legisla-
tive elections, which were completed on 22 May, and are
attempting to discredit the results in advance. While they
might attempt to set up a rump government in one or more of
the northern provinces, they would be unlikely to succeed so
long as Congolese security forces remain loyal to Belgian
authority.

Afghanistan: Foreign Minister Naim told the US charge

on 21 May that the USSR is willing to exploit and market the
oil recently discovered by a Soviet team in northern Afghan-
istan. The Afghans probably expect to accept Soviet help.
Naim, however, asked for US help in building a pipeline south-
ward, arguing that this would prevent a dangerous expansion

I11. THE WEST

[ Cuba: The Cuban Government is likely to seize the three

refineries owned by US companies in Cuba when these firms

announce, as they presently plan, their refusal to comply with
the formal Cuban order to process Soviet crude. The US Em-
bassy in Havana believes the Cuban Government may seek Soviet
assistance in providing technicians to replace displaced US cit-

izens. Soviet petroleum experts may already be among the

numerous technicians who have recently arrived in Cuba to help
implement the Soviet-Cuban trade and credit agreements signed

in February.

25X1 USSR: Soviet delegates at both the disarmament and nuclear
' test talks in Geneva have issued thinly veiled warnings that the
USSR may withdraw from the negotiations and resume nuclear
weapons tests if Western concessions are not forthcoming. At
the disarmament conference, the Soviet delegate is making a
strong effort to exploit differences in Western reactions to Mos-
cow's latest proposals. Soviet spokesmen have hinted that, in
view of the 'lack of Western cooperation,'"" the USSR may take

the issue to the UN General Assembly. Moscow's representative
in the nuclear test talks has warned that if the US and Britain go
ahead with the experimental underground explosions without ac-
cepting Moscow's conditions for Soviet participation, the USSR
will consider itself free to resume nuclear weapons tests.

N\ I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR: The first press announcement of the demobiliza-

% tion of a Soviet army division in the current program of man- %
b\ power reduction was made by TASS on the morning of 24 June. \
\\\ For the first time the USSR has permitted foreign observation \\
% of its troop cuts inside the Soviet Union, with 50 foreign cor- &
\§ respondents witnessing an official ceremony disbanding the i\
g\\ Fifth Heavy Tank ""Korsun'' Division. Two trains carrying \\\

.

1,200 demobilized tankmen were scheduled to leave the Osi~
povich1 railroad station, about 70 miles southeast of Minsk.

 

     

 

 

x\\\ K About 60 percent of the men were said to be returning to their \\\\\
Q§ 0 homes; the remainder would be sent ""at their own request' to %
\\ frontier areas in the Asiatic USSR. Reports of activity con- \\\
nected with demobilization or early release of servicemen have \\
become increasingly frequent in recent weeks. There.is no evi- §\§§

DAILY BRIEF

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

East Germany: East German police have instituted a
series of strong harassing actions against Western military
liaison missions in East Germany. Since 9 June several inci-
dents have occurred, with East German police forcing mission
vehicles to stop, threatening mission personnel with loaded
irearms, and engaging in acts of physical violence against them.
The most serious of these incidents was the physical agsault on
the chief and other members of the British mission in an unre-
stricted area near Potsdam on 21 June. The three chiefs of the
Western liaison missions believe that the deteriorating situation
may result in further serious incidents, possibly involving even
the loss of life. They also believe that the East German actions
are being taken with the approval of high-level Soviet authorities.

 

 

 

 

 

I1. ASIA-AFRICA

Belgian Congo: The government formed by Congo Premier-
designate Patrice Lumumba is ""weak"" and has a ""strong leftist
tinge,"" according to the consulate general in Leopoldville, Mem-
bers of opposition parties named to the cabinet are described as
little known and likely to be dominated by Lumumba. Among ten

MO secretaries of state;, however, five--including the secretary for
economic coordination and planning--are Communist inclined.

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR - Communist China: In the communiqué signed
in Bucharest on 24 June the Soviet Union and Communist China
reached back to 1957 for an authoritative statement of Bloc
policy which both could still accept. The communiqué merely
outlined broad principles in very general lines, leaving specific
/O K issues open to varying interpretations. For the most part it

 

consideration. Such an arrangement, by itself, does little to
resolve underlying differences between Moscow and Peiping, but

25X1 the two powers in private talks probably examined wavs of eas ing
their dispute,

CT*USSR - Berlin: In elaborating on his threat to sign a
separafe German peace treaty if the Federal Republic's
Bundestag meets in West Berlin this fall, Khrushchev last
week told Austrian officials privately that the USSR would

 

 
  

25X1 |

 

 

follow the treaty by initiating a step-by-step harassment of
the West in such a way that no one move would seem worth a
war. He emphasized that ""nobody can make me believe that
the British, French, or even the Americans will go to war to
keep Berlin for Adenauer.' Khrushchev's public and private

 

 

//474///

25X

statements in Vienna appear to be part of a continuing bloc ef-

fort to probe the West's determination and unity in maintaining '
its position in Berlin, | .

/xemen-Bloc: Moscow and Peiping are continuing to empha-
size their support for Yemen by offering cash loans as well as
other economic aid to the Imam. A Yemeni mission left for s
Peiping on 3 August to negotiate for further Chinese assistance. 0 {< o

II. ASIA-AFRICA

*Republic of the Congo: Katanga Premier Tshombé's oppo-
sition to a UN occupation of Katanga may result in a postpone-
ment of the UN's scheduled entry on 6 August. Tshombé
has threatened armed resistance to any UN occupation. Eu-
ropeans in Elisabethville are said to be concerned not only /<
by the possibility of new violence, but by Tshombé's harsh crit- o -
icism of the Belgians, whose decision not to oppose the UN entry
Tshombé regards as a betrayal. A large-scale exodus of whites
from Katanga may be imminent. The apparent stalemate appears e
certain to draw heavy fire from Lumumba, who on 4 August in Tunis 25X1
threatened ""'radical"" action if Belgian troops have not evacuated
the Congo prior to his return to Leopoldville on 8 August.

UAR: ékram al-Hawrani, Baathist leader and former \\\

UAR vice president, has left Syria and gone into exile in Leb- :1&

anon, according to a press report from Beirut. Michel Aflaq, O \\\§

25X1 the Syrian Baath's other founder, has been a political refugee ,f'/ \\
in Lebanon for some months. Hawrani has been reported to be &

associated with disgruntled Syrian civilian and military elements \\§

planning an attempt to separate Syria from Egypt and remove it \i\%

from Nasir's contr@ 25&

 

  
  

 

(Page 5)

Indonesia: Sukarno, despite army opposition, apparently
plans to ban the anti-Communist Masjumi and Socialist parties
in the near future, probably on grounds of disloyalty to the gov-
ernment. This move would be in line with Sukarno's drive toward
authoritarianism and his plan to downgrade political parties. Some N
army officials are hoping Sukarno, after having banned the two 87 < \\\\\
parties, would be willing to permit further repressive action a- SN
gainst the Communist party as a balance. Sukarno, however,
would probably permit such action only on a limited scale.

Berlin: East German Foreign Trade Minister Rau pub-
licly warned West Germany on 6 September against curtail-
ing trade with East Germany in reprisal for Communist
pressures on West Berlin, and rejected Bonn's contention
that inter-German trade is contingent on unhampered com-
munications with West Berlin. Rau asserted that retaliatory SN .
measures by West Germany ""will only hasten the measures
needed to make West Berlin a free city.' West Berlin officials
fear that the East Germans may impose new travel restrictions
this coming week end in connection with the West Berlin Indus-
trial Fair and the visit of acting Chancellor Erhard.

country's support for Communist China in the Sino-Soviet dis-

that held by the Chinese Communists, came at a time of new
manifestations of Sino-Albanian amity and further evidence of
Soviet-Albanian friction. 25X1

DAILY BRIEF

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

_

USSR-China: In apparent reply to the 21 November
People's Daily editorial which presented the familiar
Chinese arguments in the Sino-Soviet dispute, Pravda
on 23 November also editorialized on the declaration
which followed the meeting of bloc leaders in 1957. It
selected for emphasis, however, those aspects of the
declaration--for example, on peaceful coexistence and
the preventability of war--which correspond to present A K
Soviet positions. This continuation of open discussion
between the Soviet and Chinese parties while interna-
tiondl Communist leaders are still meeting in Moscow
indicates that they have been unable to resolve their dis-
agreements and suggests that they have found it difficult
to formulate a communiqué which will satisfy both parties.
The moderate tone of the Pravda editorial, however,
would appear to presage the probable nature of any com~
munique which may result--one placing heaviest empha-
sis on the majority Soviet view but so worded that the
Chinese can sign it and continue to claim that their views

25X1 are valid. | |

L

 

 

25X1 Communist China - India: Relations between Peiping
and New Delhi will be further exacerbated by several re-

cent incidents in which Indian soldiers were killed or wound-
ed on the Tibet-Sikkim border, allegedly by Chinese Com-

substantive border negotiations, and it seems unlikely that

 

the incidents represent a premediated effort by Peiping to
precipitate new clashes with the Indians. Chinese troops
are in the area, however, probably attempting to check the
re-entry of Tibetan rebels gathered in Sikkim. New Delhi,
apprehensive about its defense position in Sikkim, has re-
cently augmented and alerted Indian troops in the area_:w?

again circulating in Bangkok. The possible participants in such
a move and their motivations are by no means clear.

DAILY BRIEF

1. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 25X 1

I ASIA-AFRICA Q

Iran :@anian Prime Minister Sharif-Emami is dis-
couraged at the Shah's continued interference in government
operations and fears that the Shah is planning to rig the new
parliamentary elections as blatantly as those of last August,
which the Shah canceled following widespread protests.
Former Prime Minister Eqgbal is working hard, according
to Sharif-Emami, to persuade the Shah that the last elections
were actually satisfactory and that the same procedures
should be followed again. The prime minister also expects
the Shah to schedule elections before the new American ad-
ministration takes office in the belief that this would avoid
American pressure for freer election§}

[The Shah appears unwilling to give up his day-to-day
concern with governmental affairs--although he has insisted
several times that he would do so--and Sharif-Emami is
facing the same situation which reduced the former Prime

guard, in a surprise move early this morning sealed off the palace '
and key transport and communications installations in Addis Ababa.

. Leaders of the 6, 000-man elite military force have given no ex-

planation so far for the move, nor have the instigators been identi -
fied. +*No violence or crowd reaction was reported, and local
business activity remained normal. The Emperor, who has
been away from Ethiopia for several weeks on a tour of West Africa,
is now in Brazil, and the government is nominally in the hands of
the inexperienced crown prince. '

LATE ITEM

*Laos: The rapidity of the advance of anti-government
forces in the Plain des Jarres area northwest of Xieng Khouang
town now makes it probable that there is a ""'sizeable aggression""
from North Vietnam, according to a joint message from US
missions in Laos. On the basis of fragmentary information,
the message reports that the area is expected to fall no later
than 1 January.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC

USSR-Africa: f_Soviet Premier Khrushchev will visit
Africa in late January and early February, according to
| the Indian ambassador in Moscow. Although the specific

 

 

o schedule and dates have not been fixed, Khrushchev has ac-
//% cepted invitations to the UAR, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, and
. Ethiopia. The Soviet charge in Lome recently discussed

. _ with Prime Minister Olympio a visit by the Soviet premier
/ to Togo in January as part of a West African tour. Khru-

 

 

shchev also appears to be angling for bids from Libya and
Sudan, and may hope to include Morocco and Mali--which
have recently expanded their ties with the Communist bloc=-
on his African itinerary.

Communist China: Communist China's first announce-~
. ments of 1960 economic achievements indicate a poor harvest

year and probable underfulfillment of the plan in industry.
Natural calamities are cited as affecting the entire economy.
People's Daily reports that of the 150,000,000 acres affected
by the ""severest natural calamities in 100 years,' more than
one third sustained serious losses, with no harvest at all in
some places. Light industry, which depends on agriculture
for raw materials, will not reach planned goals this year.
Peiping claims, however, that 1960 targets for steel, iron,
coal, electric power, petroleum, machine tools, and trac-
tors will be reached in spite of production and transport in-

 

/ ;erruptionse There is considerable evidence that 1960 has /

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 25X1

 

D

 

 

 

I1, ASIA-AFRICA

 

Indonesia: President Sukarno has appointed a high
proportion of leftists, including the Communist party chair-
man, to executive bodies in the National Front, which Su-
karno heads and which he probably intends to develop as G K
Indonesia's single political party. The army's representa-
tion is fairly submerged in the Front hierarchy. Sukarno
appears to have shelved temporarily his efforts to include
Communists in the cabinet; instead, he is promoting them

- in other government organizations in the hope of gradually
working them into the direct line of government, despite
army objections. | |

The Tormer ministers of interior and of
Tinance as well as the former director of the fisheries ad-
ministration were also reported arrested. The fisheries ad-
ministration oversees the export of Iranian caviar and is,
therefore, a lucrative source of graft. Those arrested have
long been identified in the public mind with some of the more
flagrant abuses of position, and the Shah probably estimated
that the favorable public reaction would more than offset
their influence in the army or political circles. The arrests
also provide Prime Minister Amini with the first of the ""spec-
tacular' moves he hopes to make to impress the public with

 

 

~Africa: The conference in Monrovia of 20 moderate Af=
rican states ended on 12 May after agreeing to reconvene in
Lagos soon--possibly before the next UN General Assembly
session, where they intend to present a united front. The
meeting's final communiqué adopts the standard African na-
tionalist lines on Angola and South Africa; however, since
many of the participants are sympathetic toward France and
Katanga, it takes a cautious line on the Congo and Algeria.
The participating countries have agreed in principle that at
the next meeting in Lagos they will set up an ""African co-
operation organization' which would include machinery for
settling disputes among members. The conference also
agreed to establish a body for economic and cultural coopera-
tion. The refusal of the radical African states--Ghana,
Guinea, Mali, Morocco, and the UAR--to attend has strength-
ened the trend on the continent toward division into moderate

and radical blocs. /

*South Korea: (Information available as of 0500 EDT)
The only military units thus far identified with the military
coup staged in Seoul in the early morning hours of 16 May
are elements of the South Korean Second Army and some
marine units. The rest of the army, the air force, and
most navy elements reportedly have not thus far participated
in the revolutionary activity; which way they will throw their
support is not clear. Although the ""military revolutionary
committee"" set up shortly after the coup claims that it con-
trols the entire country, and evidently does control the city
-of Seoul, and possibly Taegu, it is still questionable whether
the coup leaders have sufficient support to retain power.

The ""military revolutionary committee,",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A005700180001-9,/meta-50800,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1961

DAILY BRIEF

 

*Dominican Republic: dgrbitra,ry arrests, torture, and
murder of suspected dissidents have been intensified as the
dead dictator's survivors seek to avenge his assassination.
The American consul reported on 2 June that moderate dis-
sident elements in the capital are terror-stricken and are
urging the United States to send help immediately on whatever
pretext. The consul was informed that General ""Ramfis""
25X1 Trujillo, the late dictator's 31-year-old son who on 1 June
was named head of the joint chiefs of staff of the Dominican
armed forces, has vowed to ""wipe out' the opposition. The
consul is convinced that President Balaguer is now ""firmly
in the hands of 'Ramfis",https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79T00975A005700340001-1,/meta-57400,CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN,matched (3),1961

*Dominican Republic: Dominican authorities may be having
some success in creating the impression that the regime is turn-
ing away from the ruthless policies of the past. The presence
of the OAS subcommittee, which arrived in the Dominican Repub- /
lic on 7 June, will temporarily hamper General Ramfis Trujillo
in any public manifestation of his drive to consolidate his posi-
tion in the armed forces.

On 7 June his public relations adviser remarked to a news-
man that General Jose Roman, minister of defense, had ""es-
caped."" He had earlier been reported under arrest, and yester-
day a presidential decree formally removed him from his post.
General Roman, believed friendly to the US, is known to have
had personal difficulties with Ramfis in the past and to have had
contact with dissident elements prior to the assassination. Ram-
fis probably considers Roman's elimination a necessary step in 25X1
gaining full control of the armed forces.

Official Dominican allegations on 7 June that the assassina-
tion of Trujillo was part of a 'vast conspiracy with ramifications
in a foreign country' are probably a prelude to an effort to impli-
cate Venezuelan President Betancourt. This charge, which could
probably be backed up by the Dominicans with plausible evidence,
could be used in an attempt to urge removal of the OAS sanctions
imposed against the Dominican Republic last August and prompted
by Trujillo's effort to kill Betancourt. The American Consulate
believes that the now-publicized contacts which a private American
citizen had with the dissidents may later be used in an effort to
implicate the United States, if this should serve the regime's pur-

25X1  poses. |
\ [The Venezuelan foreign minister told Ambassador Moscoso
yesterday that Colombia, earlier reported as reluctant to join
possible joint action against the Dominican regime, is now a-
greeable to advancing the date of Venezuelan-Colombian joint
25X1 fleet maneuvers previously agreed on for 18 to 25 June, and to
moving its participating vessels from Colombian waters to the
vicinity of the Dominican Republic. The Colombian vessels will
consist of two destroyers and a frigate. Venezuela will have
three destroyers participating. Both countries are agreeable to
continuing the maneuvers as long as necessary. A Venezuelan
navy captain was to leave for Colombia yesterday to serve as  29X1
liaison between the two fleet unitsl

*Turkey: Elgh level personnel changes now occurring

within the ruling Committee for National Union (CNU) and the

} Turkish armed forces are apparently part of a power struggle
within the CNU over the role that body should play in the future
and over the timing of a return to civil government. The CNU
is the leading body of the military regime which ousted the oK
Menderes government in May 1960. The changes have report-
edly involved the ouster and subsequent reinstatement of the
chief of the air force, Lt. Gen. Irfan Tansel, and the resigna-
tion of General Madanoglu one of the leading members of the
CNU, from his post as troop commander of the Ankara garri-
son. Several other top-level military changes are also appar-
ently being made.]

[General Tansel, in a possible overstatement of his case,
claims to have the support of the commanders of the ground
and naval forces and the gendarmerie, as well as support from
the younger members of the CNU. He is apparently opposed by
senior officers on the CNU. He told the US air attaché on 10
June that his group was in control and that he would direct Tur-
key ''on the Western road to democracy."" The CNU, following
a meeting attended by the General Staff chief,issued a statement
on 11 June playing down the s1gn1f1cance of the personnel changes
and declaring its determination to hold """"democratic and honest
elections' before 29 October, as previously announceg

ting the possibility of a major clash between elements of the
army and air force, believe it is too soon for allegiances to have
crystallized to a point where it can be assumed that either the
air force or army would act as a unified service. Tansel's con-
trol of the air force, however, is probably firm as a result of
major changes which he has made in his staff officers./

cording to Tansel, some members of the CNU wanted to
perpetuate strong military influence in the regime, even afte17

in mid-September when the Delegation Generale, the central
French administration for Algeria, is to be transferred 25
miles east of Algiers to the new administrative center at

USSR: The 29 August announcement by Moscow that it was
halting the discharge of ""necessary numbers' of servicemen
whose tours were scheduled to expire in 1961 could, if accom-
panied by the induction of the usual number of draftees during
the year, mean the addition of 750,000 to 800,000 men to the S (
present total of about 3,000,000 men in the Soviet armed forces.
It appears unlikely, however, that anything like 750,000 to
800,000 will be added. The retention of technicians, special-
ists, and noncommissioned officers due for discharge this 25X1
year, plus normal recruitment, could result in the addition
of as many as 350,000 to the Soviet armed forces. | |

France-Algeria: Lljeaders of the provisional Algerian
government have indicated that the rebels will ask their
Swiss intermediaries to seek a resumption of negotiations
with the French. T Although both sides seem to desire nego-

tiations, there are indications that the rebels do not feel
as much urgency as the French to reach an early settlement. /M

 

 

 

Rebel leaders have also indicated uncertainty and suspicion

as to the actual extent of De Gaulle's concessions on the

Sahara, and resumed negotiations could founder on this or

other issues. | | 25X1

led by Minister of Health Gbedemah now appear determined

USSR-Berlin: @reign Minister Gromyko used his in-
formal conversations with the American, British, and West
German ambassadors at a 7 November reception to under-

Ambassador Smirnov has instructions to meet with Chancel-

Gromyko made no mention of a peace treaty and confirmed

Dominican Republic: //The National Civic Union (UCN),
the Iargest opposition grotip, appears to be losing some. of
its support. Business and professional people, who form the
backbone of the UCN, are showing considerable disillusion-
ment with its leaders for political mismanagement and in-
temperance during the UCN-inspired general strike, which
failed to achieve its objectives. Student groups, on the other
hand, are showing a more pronounced inclination toward
revolutionary action, and the extreme leftist-led 14 June
party (PCJ), which was inactive during the strike, may win
more adherents. .

 

 

25X1

 

e

 

 

o moderate opposition groups, however, have also
gained influence since the beginning of the strike, and may
be in a position to compete effectively with the PCJ's ex-
tremist leaders if UCN influence continues to decline.
